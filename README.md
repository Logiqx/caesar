# CAESAR 

### Catalogue of Arcade Emulation Software - the Absolute Reference

This project includes my original development environment for the website hosted on [caesar.logiqx.com](http://caesar.logiqx.com).

All of the code was originally tracked / managed locally using CVS but I have decided to upload it to GitHub.

The migration process has been [documented](Migration.md) should you be interested in how I migrated from CVS to Git.
