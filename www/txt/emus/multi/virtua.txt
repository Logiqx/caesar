emulator	virtua	multi	Virtua	\N	\N	\N	Virtua	-	30/10/2000	DOS	Sega Model 2 Games (Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop 2, Daytona USA etc)	Unfortunately Richard had to stop development due to other commitments but he released Virtua and it's source to the community. It emulates the games to a certain degree but there is no polygon support so games are not playable. If you feel like a challenge then finishing off Virtua might be just the thing. :)	Discontinued
