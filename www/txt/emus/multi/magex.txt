emulator	magex	multi	MageX_v0.8a	\N	\N	\N	MageX	0.8a	03/11/1997	Windows	Variety of games from the early 80's	Uses the old MAME samples (.sam format) for some games. Sample names in the MageX v0.8a data file (inside the Older Emus pack from www.logiqx.com) are believed to be correct. They were derived by examining the strings within the emulator executable and by running the emulator itself. Please do not question the data file validity, even if the samples here do not match the data file. They were the best that I could find but do not mean that the data file is incorrect!	Dormant
