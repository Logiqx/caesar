It strives to recreate the experience of playing the games as they were in the arcade, and requires the original game ROMS in order to run. In some cases copies of the original sound files and artwork are required to complete the emulation experience. It provides for simulation options that are not available in MAME, and offers several features that are not available in MAME due to their arcade preservation charter, such as advanced hardware based drawing and motion blur.
