emulator	tickle	multi	Tickle_Rebound_Edition	\N	\N	\N	Tickle	"Rebound" Edition	10/08/2005	Windows	Arcade classics from the 1980s	Tickle is an object oriented framework written to develop hardware emulators, but it can also used to write simple games and similar stuff. Tickle is composed by a portable library of functions and interfaces, and by an OS-dependent front end that provides access to system input and output devices (keyboard, mouse, joystick, sound, video and so on). The "Rebound" Edition contains a circuit emulator for Atari's Rebound (1973). It is far from complete and very CPU intensive but worth a look!	Active
