E2MAME is free software and currently runs on Series 60 phones: Nokia N-Gage, Siemens SX-1, Nokia 6600, and probably most other models. The very first Series 60 models, the Nokia 7650 and Nokia 3650, can only run the miniature version of E2MAME, called "Micro-E2MAME", due to very limitied memory. Series 60 Feature pack 2 phones, e.g., Nokia 6630 and Nokia 6680. These models, surprisingly, have a bit less free memory than earlier Series 60 phones; therefore only Mini-E2MAME runs on these. UIQ phones: Motorola A920/A925/A1000, and maybe more? The Nokia 9500 and 9300 Communicators. The Nokia 7710 are supported by Mini-E2MAME.	Dormant
