Since these machines did not have a CPU and ROM code it's hard to simulate these machines using traditional emulation. Pure functional simulation of these games is also error prone especially since most people do not have access to the original hardware to compare against. The approach taken by DiscreteSIM is to simulate the game circuit at the component level using a generic digital logic simulator. Unfortunately the component level simulation is takes a lot of processing power so even on a very fast PC it probably will not produce a playable frame rate. On an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ system it takes about 8 seconds to render each frame.	Dormant
