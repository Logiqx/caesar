This project is a good source of information on the software and hardware of many arcade games. You now have a fully-featured Java version to play with. If you are not familiar with C or the complex MAME compilation, you can use the Java version instead, try to write new drivers or experiment with the emulator and built-in debugger, etc.	Active
