Tailgunner is an exact Java port of the arcade game Tailgunner, which was originally written by Dan Sunday of Vectorbeam in 1979. The Java version was created by translating the Tailgunner program code, originally written for Cinematronics' proprietary C-CPU, to Java. This translation was made by a static binary recompilation program by Graham Toal. Norbert Kehrer ported the translated code to Java and wrote the graphics and user interface functions.	Dormant
