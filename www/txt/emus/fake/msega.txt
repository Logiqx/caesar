Comparing Model 2 Emulator. v0.1 alpha versus MSega whateverversion.crap. The Hex Workshop comparison shown, only matches, gives two main sections, one A1F8F bytes long and another one 6BDD4 bytes long, both at the same offsets in each file. That means that only two sections give 1105251 matching bytes. The emulators are roughly 1114112 bytes long, so 99% of them are exactly the same.	Discontinued
