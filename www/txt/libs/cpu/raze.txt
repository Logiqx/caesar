library	raze	cpu	RAZE (Multi Asm Z80 Engine)	1.06	30/06/2001	\N	Zilog Z80	The most accurate z80 emulator. Has almost perfect emulation and has proper IRQ line handling (unlike most other Z80 emus). In addition to arcade emulators it is also used by Pasofami (Nintendo NES/Famicom) and DGen (Dave's Genesis/Megadrive emulator - the guy who did DTMNT and Final Burn).
