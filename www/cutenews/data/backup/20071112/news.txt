1193841304|neoforma|Mjolnir v0.4|Mjolnir has arrived. Phil released another update to his Namco System 21/22 emulator a couple of hours ago. The best news is that Solvalou is fixed and playable now. Some fixes were made to other games too.|||3||
1192465926|neoforma|MAME v0.120|Only three days ago there was an update and now there is a full version. The most interesting part is a new 64-bit version for those who have a modern PC. Most games run as in 32-bit version, but some other run about 10-15% faster, so you might want to try it.<br /><br />Also be sure to update your Neo-Geo roms, because they changed a lot.|||3||
1192302790|neoforma|Mjolnir v0.3.1|Another update. Full screen wasn't working as intended, so it was fixed again. Also some fixes were made to Prop Cycle textures.|||3||
1192265947|neoforma|Mjolnir v0.3|Phil Stroffolino has released a new version of <a href="http://machna.com/games/">Mjolnir</a>.  Full screen support added, some bugfixes made. Looks like <b>Starblade</b> can be finished now.|||3||
1191704480|neoforma|OldSpark C++|Bruno Vedder has released <a href="http://bcz.emu-france.com/">second public version</a> of his emulator for Windows and Linux.<br /><br />Currently it supports only 13 games such as <b>Pac-Man</b>, <b>Solomon's Key</b>, <b>Galaxian</b> and a couple of clones.|||3||
1191443029|neoforma|Mjolnir v0.2|Phil has released the <a href="http://machna.com/games/">second version</a> of his System 21, System 22 and Super System 22 emulator. It's built upon MAME v0.100, so it should be faster than modern MAME versions.<br /><br />It supports 27 sets such as <b>Starblade</b>, <b>Alpine Racer</b>, <b>Prop Cycle</b>, a couple of <b>Ridge Racers</b> and some other games.|||3||
1191273231|neoforma|Mjolnir v0.1|<a href="http://machna.com/games/">Phil Stroffolino</a> has released his long-awaited <a href="http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=536">Namco System 21</a> and <a href="http://system16.com/hardware.php?id=537">Namco System 22</a> emulator, but unfortunately there was a bug in it and so he unreleased it.<br /><br />Since Phil was able to reproduce this bug, there will be a new release soon (hopefully). His emulator will run games faster than MAME and make them playable on current high-end PCs.|||3||
1189707388|neoforma|MAME v0.119|Finally it's here. There were several regressions along the way, but Aaron fixed most of them in v0.118u6, so there shouldn't be any problems with this release.<br /><br />In the other news, some new clones added and decryption keys for the last dumped CPS-2 games are found by Nicola Salmoria and David Haywood.|||3||
1188677533|neoforma|CPX3 v1.0a|A little bit late to inform anyone interested, but still it's better late than never. ElSemi has released CPX3 (CPS 3 emulator for Xbox), so now Xbox owners (not Xbox 360, but the original one) can play CPS3 games too.<br /><br />No links provided since it's made with XDK, but you'll be able to find the emulator mostly everywhere.|||3||
1187722180|neoforma|JEmu2 v4.1|I'm quite sure the new version was posted today, even though the date shows August 29.<br /><br />Some fixes are made and Out Run driver added. Try to beat other people's highscore <a href="http://gagaplay.com/jemu2/">online<a/>.|||3||
1186363325|neoforma|MAME v0.118|This one is a week earlier than might be expected. There are major changes in core and virtually no new games added. There is even minimalistic menu, so it would be easier for new users to start using MAME and stop asking questions why MAME is a DOS program.<br /><br />Go straight to <a href="http://mamedev.org">MAMEDev</a> and start testing.|||3||
1186172810|neoforma|FBA v0.2.96.72|Even though Barry says that list of changes isn't exhaustive, in reality it's quite long. There are many new drivers and games added, so you wouldn't want to miss it. Be sure to check <a href="http://www.barryharris.me.uk/">Barry's blog</a> for the full list of changes and downloads.<br /><br />FBA official site is down again.|||3||
1184532592|neoforma|Capcom Play System 3 Emulator v1.0a|ElSemi has fixed some nasty bugs in CPS3 emulation (like Alt versions of SFIII 3rd Strike and JoJo's Venture CHDs not loading at all), so be sure to <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">check it</a>.<br /><br />This version is fully compatible with the romset of v1.0.|||3||
1184103677|neoforma|MAME v0.117|Logiqx has already made a datafile while I was excited about TinyMAME finally being fixed and ridden of Poly-Play.<br /><br />CPS-3 is finished, Neo-Geo driver is updated and MAME is going to be emulated in MAME (some day).|||3||
1183936177|neoforma|Capcom Play System 3 Emulator v1.0|ElSemi released final version of his <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">CPS-3 Emulator</a>. It emulates transparencies (sort of, not the actual thing) and CHDs. If anyone is still curious about the differences between CHD and no CHD games &mdash; there are none. Only the loading time. CHDs take much more time to boot.<br /><br />Andreas made a post with CPS-3 keys on June 9. It took a month to emulate everything.|||3||
1183816081|neoforma|Raine v0.50.5|<a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">Raine</a> is not finished yet!<br /><br />Emmanuel has released a new version just today. It fixes some of the problems of previous version, adds hiscore support for some of the games and makes small changes to how the scanlines work.|||3||
1182985226|neoforma|DiscreteSIM v1.0|A couple of days ago Dan Boris released a <a href="http://atarihq.com/danb/Pong.shtml">Pong! emulator</a>. As many other vintage arcade games of 70s Pong! doesn't use any CPU, so it seems that the only way to emulate it is to simulate the operation of the original circuit using a generic digital logic simulator.<br /><br />Don't hold your breath. The emulation is so slow, that even on the fastest PCs today it's more of a slideshow than a game (<strong>eight seconds</strong> to render <strong>one frame</strong> on AMD Athlon 64 3000+). Also some things are not working properly, but it's good to see that a game that was dropped from MAME is not forgotten.|||3||
1182607265|neoforma|Capcom System 3 Emulator v0.1|Since ElSemi has already released a <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">new version</a> which really shows the progress of CPS-3 emulation, I've decided it would be a right thing to post about it here.<br /><br />If you prefer MAME, you can try <a href="http://mamedev.org/release.html">v0.116u2</a>. It already works with CPS-3 games.|||3||
1182384591|neoforma|Capcom System 3 Emulator v0.0|ElSemi has finally made it. The first working (sort of) emulator of CPS-3.<br /><br />It's still an early preview version with many features missing, but it's the most one can expect in merely two weeks after system's encryption was broken.<br /><br /><a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Take a look</a> if you have a decent PC. Amazing stuff.|||3||
1181560170|neoforma|MAME v0.116|New version released and so is datafile. You can grab your own MAME v0.116 from <a href="http://mamedev.org">MAMEDev</a>.<br /><br />Good news for everyone who loves CPS-3: Emulation is possible. Please don't start trashing forums with questions on where to get ROMs, though : )|||3||
1180603377|neoforma|Sega Model 2 Emulator v0.5a|Just five days after the last release ElSemi made a quick <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">bugfix version</a>. This release fixes analog wraparound bug and wrong color tables in Virtua Cop.<br /><br />Aside from that there also two new functions added: An ability to run games from commandline and an option to auto-switch to full screen after the game is launched.|||3||
1180051401|neoforma|Sega Model 2 Emulator v0.5|All new and shiny <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">v0.5</a>. ElSemi has fixed some bugs in Daytona USA and added Motor Raid!<br /><br />It's really great to see that Model 2 finally gets attention it deserves.|||3||
1178478605|neoforma|MAME v0.115|New version of MAME is still not available from the <a href="http://mame.net">main site</a>, but Logiqx has already updated the datafile.<br /><br />You can grab your all new and shiny copy of MAME v0.115 from <a href="http://mamedev.org">mamedev.org</a>.|||3||
1178067430|neoforma|The last Raine?|After more than two months of silence a new <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">Raine 0.50.4</a> is released.<br /><br />Looks like this one might be the final version. Some (or all?) bugs were cleared out, mouse behavior is fixed and autofire function is back.|||3||
