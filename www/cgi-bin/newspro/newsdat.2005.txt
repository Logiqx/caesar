I'll try to explain it, if I got it right: it's an universal device to interface arcade pcb's to PC's, allowing trojaning and analisys of protection gadgets or encrypted CPU's. Pretty much as Charles McDonald's method of reading the protected CPU's, but geared towards any kind of chip. It uses a combination of custom hardware to link the pcb's and software to drive the tests. It will also allow programmers to test unknown functions in the target CPU's, analyze the meaning of obscure registers, and in general it seems to be a really great tool for emulation developers out there. Bryan says that hardware schematics and software will be available soon.``xpi``xpi@logiqx.com``xNothing else interesting has happened lately...``x1104880899,27537,``x``x
