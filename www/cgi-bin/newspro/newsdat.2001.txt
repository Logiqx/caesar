This give you every available mode in the Screen Setup dialog when you change the depth or the scanlines. This also select for you the best video mode available keeping your options (scanlines, pixel double...) for every game you load.<br><br>* Fixed music tempo and sound effects in psykio games (gunbird, sengoku ace, and battle k road).<br><br>* Made the music acceleration in toaplan2 games optional (Set fast_tp2_sound to 0 in raine.cfg if you don't like it)<br><br>* Added a cache for solid sprite to get a 20-30% increase in speed for mazinger and most toaplan2 games (batrider...).<br><br>* Added speed hacks to every cave games : a little faster on slow machines, and animations smoother on fast machines !<br><br>* New palette update function for 8bpp modes for Windows 9x fullscreen modes, and linux fbcon.

``xGot a PocketPC?  Whether you have a iPAQ, HP56x, Jornada color or Casio E10x, the latest version of <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mamece3/">MAMECE3</a> (courtesy of <a href="mailto:mamece3@yahoo.com">Techmaster</a>) is what you need.  Here what's new:<br><br>- Enabled Support for most available PocketPC 2002 Devices, the HP56x series, the Ipaq 3800 and the 3700 (I believe). <br><br>- Enabled proper key definitions and support for the @migo (however it has not been tested). <br><br>- Enabled globally accessible, unique identification code. This allows me to code specific functionality into current and future releases based on this Device ID and the manufacturer of the device. Previously I used basic ifdef statements based on the CPU, which is no longer a valid way to id the device since they will all be ARM :) <br><br>- Implemented the iPaq 3800 display workaround. The iPaq 3800 has a bug which causes GAPI screen access to be delayed (creating a severe display redraw penalty). By implementing this in conjunction with my Unique ID I can use or not use the GAPI functions in the same code.<br><br>- Tinkered with the sound routines. Still no major improvement. <br><br>- Improved Graphics routines. Display redraws should be a fraction faster. <br><br>- Preliminary evaluation of support for the Grayscale devices. <br><br>- Fixed gx.dll install on PocketPC 2002. Cab files now install properly even if you answer No to installing the gx.dll (previously it would fail to install at all).``xrob``xrob@logiqx.com``xMAMECE3 9.3``x1008137554,51329,``x``x
