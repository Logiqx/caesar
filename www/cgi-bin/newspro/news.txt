1008137554|rob|MAMECE3 9.3|Got a PocketPC?  Whether you have a iPAQ, HP56x, Jornada color or Casio E10x, the latest version of <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mamece3/">MAMECE3</a> (courtesy of <a href="mailto:mamece3@yahoo.com">Techmaster</a>) is what you need.  Here what's new:<br><br>- Enabled Support for most available PocketPC 2002 Devices, the HP56x series, the Ipaq 3800 and the 3700 (I believe). <br><br>- Enabled proper key definitions and support for the @migo (however it has not been tested). <br><br>- Enabled globally accessible, unique identification code. This allows me to code specific functionality into current and future releases based on this Device ID and the manufacturer of the device. Previously I used basic ifdef statements based on the CPU, which is no longer a valid way to id the device since they will all be ARM :) <br><br>- Implemented the iPaq 3800 display workaround. The iPaq 3800 has a bug which causes GAPI screen access to be delayed (creating a severe display redraw penalty). By implementing this in conjunction with my Unique ID I can use or not use the GAPI functions in the same code.<br><br>- Tinkered with the sound routines. Still no major improvement. <br><br>- Improved Graphics routines. Display redraws should be a fraction faster. <br><br>- Preliminary evaluation of support for the Grayscale devices. <br><br>- Fixed gx.dll install on PocketPC 2002. Cab files now install properly even if you answer No to installing the gx.dll (previously it would fail to install at all).|||1||

1012434140|pi|More superheroes for your emulator|I've seen word over at <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/">Retrogames</a> that in <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/">The Guru's ROM Dump News</a> you can see screenshots of a game called <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/">Captain America And The Avengers</a>, which I never heard of before, or saw in the arcades, but nonetheless it looks cool and another success in emulation. Brian Troha said in Retrogames something more about the upcoming MAME driver by Brian McPhail. But since he told it to Retrogames and not me, go <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/">there</a> to read the full (short) story. Don't forget to take a look on the screenshots!|||1||

1012520165|pi|Not even a little clue! Help!|If you go <a href="http://www.geocities.com/unemulated/">here</a> you can see some colorful and good looking snapshots of an arcade game. The problem is, I don't remember who is the maintainer of that page, nor the name of the page. Plus, I don't know the name of that game and I don't know any far east language (I suposse) to even read the title. I think it will be for MAME but that's again only my guess. Nonetheless the game looks good and it reminds me of a similar game...<br>Not bad for a news poster, this really shows my knowledge :)|||1||

Also kudos to the other news posters who featured me in such nice sites :)<br>Besides that, it has been one month since I've stopped smoking. My target is closer everyday. It's possible, so you could also try. Soon my board sig will change to reflect it :)<br>I was going to mention that I almost didn't come today, that probably tomorrow I will not be here, that we want another news poster... But ZERO is the number of people who contacted me about that. So, again, read yesterday's last post again, and think about it... We want your help!<br>And to finish, Morrigan is much more cute, smart, fast, powerful, sexy, gorgeous and also has more you-know-what than Lilith.

Anyway if you go there now, there are even more screenshots showing how the driver got improved step by step, quite interesting. Also that colorful game which was in that page (Noboranka) appears in the current WIP. Does that mean that this page is maintained by D.

1012693943|pi|Not all days are good days|I was "lurking" for news and saw in <a href="http://www.arcadeheaven.com/">ARH</a> a sad link for some screenshots of <a href="http://www.roarvgm.com/kof2k1/">King of Fighters 2001</a>. Which more or less means it's already emulated, at least the screenshots look like taken with an emulator. I already saw it commented in the boards, but until now I didn't saw the snaps. For me these are negative news, in my opinion such a recent game already emulated hurts the arcade business, and without arcade business, there will be no new arcade games. This is about emulation, about preservation, not about warez!|||1||

As said, the fix was going to come soon... Still they serve the file on FilePlanet, but it's possible to download it, just choose it from the "public servers" list instead of the "personal servers" which are a pay service. However the public servers are collapsed and you have to "wait online" and swallow several ads. Maybe the MAME32 guys will notice it and distribute this MAME version from some other place... I'm sure many people will want to help them.<br>On other things, they have also released the MAME Flyer pack #17, also available on FilePlanet :-/<br>And they mention of the idea of opening again the MAME32 forums. Maybe.|||1||

1014418400|pi|How many screenshots do you want?|First thing which catched my attention when I got back: new <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP!</a> This time you have lots of things since day 19, screenshots from many many games. David Haywood has been working in Hitachi SH-2 emulation, for Psikyo games and also for the Super Kaneko Nova System. All the screenshots are from games on these systems, for example Strikers 1945 II, Jan Jan Paradise, Sol Divide, Gals Panic 4... Many many games. Other news in text form are there, as usual. I'd like to remark Gile's addition of hard disk image support, I hope it means some good additions to MAME and MESS soon.|||1||
1014418457|pi|CPS2(little)shock|Not a XOR release, but <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock</a> got updated and that's always something good. I think :) This time Raz has updated the CPS-2 gamelist with Choko and Jyankokushi screenshots for example, and other additions as well. Nice!|||1||
1014418566|pi|PacMAME in elegant costumes|More <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/pacmame/">PacMAME</a> for your pleasure. At first, you start to drool with some pics of a cabinet, a modified HotRod SE (donate one to me!), etc... Then you read some WIP, looking very nice, including "discovered 8 previously unemulated sets". And then you get a PacMAME .55 (.NET) and PacTray 7.5.2 update, so it's quite hard to expect more. Oh well, we expect more, but give the team some time. They are only two :)|||1||
1014418585|pi|How small your ROMS can be?|This is not a real surprise, but at the <a href="">ClrMAMEPro homepage</a>, Roman has been busy with ZipMax version this, that, and that other. I mean 0.32 currently :) The last bit about ZipMax is a tip on how to get the most out of ZipMax, read it on Roman's page. And where's ClrMAMEPro? In the to-do list, be patient! Roman has all the right to play with this toy which all of us like :)<br>|||1||
1014419207|pi|The most busy hospital of the world?|Of course, <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/">M.A.S.H.'s</a> hasn't dissapointed me, and he has made lots of work during my ausence. For example, Compile MAME Package 0.58 Release 2 with Pong working fine. Also FMAME32 0.58 Release 2. This one has lots of enhancements in the form of folders for CPU types, drivers, etc... Very nice! And the star, MAMEInfo 3.84, with correct "Recommended Games" names, whatever that means. I guess I have to download all now to check it!|||1||
1014419258|pi|MacMAME after so long!|I wonder, no one has noticed? <a href="http://www.macmame.org/downloads.html">MacMAME 0.58</a>! Ready for you thanks to Brad Oliver!

1014421461|pi|FandeHistory.dat|Fandemame has released <a href="http://fandemame.fr.st/">History.dat 0.58a</a> (a bit after 0.58). The History.dat is in english, but since the page is in french, I can't really tell you what it has new... Something about more compatibility with MAME32? That it's totally compatible but MAME32 has GUI problems with the display of history.dat? Ah, l'amour... Something I don't feel for french language :) Thanks again to <a href="http://www.emuhq.com/">PeterD</a> for the bit, everyday I hate C&G more and more!!!|||1||

Not as bizarre as the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120753">Million Dollar Hotel</a> but at least as interesting! Sega, Atari and Konami new things for our pleasure, certainly I do not get tired of surfing this site up and down, it's great! No wonder why they got One Million Visitors, and celebrate it with this update! Congrats Sixtoe!|||1||

1014493203|pi|Play it again, Sam|I've seen at <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock</a> that ElSemi has released Jukebox 2.0. It's a sound player ofr CPS-1, CPS-2, NeoGeo and ZN games. The main improvements are on the sound quality section, but it's cool to see that there is a new GUI made by MHz. I don't say that old one was bad, it means that ElSemi and MHz are working together, certainly that's a good combo! <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com">Nebula's official page</a> is under some redesign, in the meanwhile you can get it and Jukebox from the <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock download section</a>.|||1||
1014507536|pi|Haze still on it|Another <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> is available for our enjoyment. David Haywood (again) added another game to the new Psikyo driver, same glitches as the rest.

On the other hand, <a href="http://www.mame.dk/">mame.dk</a> has interrupted downloads, for *all* users. The reason is not clear right now, but you can guess why by yourself.

They are at <a href="http://www.tinywindowsgames.com/tiny/">TinyWindowsGames.com</a> and they are (as read in the page) a DynoFoo Production. There are some games (not emulators) and then five tiny emulators for Pengo, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Frogger and (which else) PacMan. Why "tiny"? Cause they are TINY! Gotta see them by yourself :) I tried Tiny Pacman and it's too cute! This is a tiny and cool alternative to MAME :)<br>I'm quite happy, sorry I forgot where I saw these... Hey Logiqx, add them to CAESAR! :)|||1||

Changes? Well, Nebula .dat support, some fixes, all the CPS2 XOR'ed games are playable, a readme.txt, and a few more things. Go and get the binary, sources will be up soon.|||1||

And like he always put, with Pong! Since he doesn't keep a easily accessable changelog, I guess the changes are the filters for Mahjong and Quiz games, and the columns for category and source driver names. There might be other things, but just these two look good enough to me.|||1||
1014586517|pi|X-Ray glasses and see thru everything|<a href="http://haggar.emuunlim.com/">Haggar's page</a> has been updated with a new section: Nebula transparencies tables. I collected some for him from spanish sites, but I guess he is wanting more, so if you create or have some, help him. If you don't have any, go and get the first pack which was already updated with work from the very own Raz. The total is now 51 tables. Nebula + Transparencies = Cool!<br>Also, you are still in time on entering his logo contest (look the news at 19th Feb on <a href="http://haggar.emuunlim.com/">his site</a>), so maybe it's your opportunity to show the scene that you're a talented artist :)|||1||
1014663141|pi|This is the "end", my only friend, the "end"|Sad news at <a href="">mame.dk</a>: no rom downloads. Well, the story is short: a copyright holder came in, they disabled the downloads and took the weekend to think about it, and now they have removed <i>permanently</i> the downloads. You can read the full story in the statement they left on the main <a href="">mame.dk</a> page.<br>I'd like to thank the mame.dk team for such a good service for the community, you have helped all this thing of reliving and preserving classic arcade games.<br>On the other hand, it's not a definitive "end", they will keep maintaining the site and database with all the features, and maybe some new features in the future. So let's call it a "feature change".|||1||

It's name is <a href="http://www.trouble-makers.com/kami/emulation/main.html">TVMAME32</a>, and it's in synch with the latest 0.58 sources.

1014754606|pi|It's RAINEing :)|Yep, <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">RAINE 0.35</a> has been released some minutes ago. Like they say, no new games, but lots of fixes. You've read right, they focused on improving current emulation instead of adding lots of buggy drivers :)<br>You can go to your usual <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">RAINE Official site</a> and get it, while you do it, you can either read the <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/rainedoc/node67.html">long changelog</a> or read my condensed version with the most important things:<ul><li>Updated docs! Woohoo! Zaxxon1 and Liliana helped with them, plus Liliana made a new background for the GUI.</li><li>Stephane Humbert (Stephh) updated the cheats for RAINE, plus fixing lots of DSW in the toaplan2 driver and locating bugs in it as well.</li><li>Logiqx made some dozens of ROM changes, making RAINE a lot more compatible with the MAME sets, it will make easier to maintain RAINE roms :) And he also detected some bad dumps so the new sets will improve some games a lot.</li><li>An incredible amount of sound fixes, including Q-Sound for CPS-1 games. A good amount of emulation fixes as well, this release is greatly improved in that part.</li><li>A lot of other fixes related to the GUI and general emulation. </li></ul>So you're going to play the same RAINE games, but certainly you will play them better! In my opinion, a high quality release :)|||1||

That's totally <b>false</b>. I wish that those sites would explain it better. mame.dk is not dead, just that it doesn't serve roms anymore. And that doesn't make it a worse site, not at all. And I always liked the design :) So mame.dk is still there, as big and good as always. Now go and search your roms somewhere else.<br>But the mame.dk team is infinitely patient, and they updated their page with three directions on getting roms, and so made <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MameWorld</a>.<br>In the boards some people are discussing about possible solutions for obtaining/serving roms. For now the ideas seem a bit vague to me. Until one of them starts to work and everyone of us follow it, I think it's too early to say everyone "do this and all the romz in da world will be yours". Everyone be patient!<br>|||1||

And with good news, ElSemi has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Nebula 2.0</a>! I'm downloading it right now, so sonn I will briefly post the changes.<br><b>Update:</b> Indeed this is a major version change! The changelog is pretty long, and full of good things. Remarkable is the new windowed GUI, while the old fullscreen GUI is also available. Is MHz also behind this GUI? Probably not, ElSemi would have said so... He says it briefly: "Due to the big amount of changes I'd recommend that you read all the docs." Rewritten main core, new improved shots factory, new macro code, NeoGeo enhancements, CPS-1 hacks addition, faster and more accurate CPS-2 GFX code (plus many improvements)... Well, this looks like a <b>very</b> good release, thanks ElSemi for such a good work. And happy birthday!<br><b>2nd Update:</b> Oh I forgot to mention, there is a bug in the old fullscreen GUI, which makes it unable to work, so use the new windowed GUI while he releases the 2.0a version I guess.

Maybe one day he will try to make fun out of me, and he will reach half the way... Go and read it if you want, I had more laughs with A Wonderful Mind, but more laughs are always worth it :)<br>(Note: I am not saying this issue is not funny, but I remember by first BitRod issue and it was VERY funny, compared to that, this is a joke told in a funeral. But still funny.)<br><b>Change:</b> Well, it has TWO damn good jokes which made this issue rate 9/10 on my I-had-a-good-damn-laugh scale.

This way you're sure you've not missed any sticker, fonts, mazes, or any of the dozen goodies this pack has.|||1||

Then we can find Ameridarts, Art & Magic System, Killer Instinct (I said it!), Driver's Edge, and three Atari Systems: G42, GX2 and GT. All this sounds too good, but as usual...

Also I can't test it cause [insert favorite excuse here], but the GUI is simple and anyway it supossedly only shows graphics out of the roms, so no real emulation happens.

You can use them to produce dats which contain the difference between one dat and another (i.e. emulator updates), but with the tiny mode, you only creat the needed roms, instead of recreating the whole games. This allows to create even smaller updates but still playable (as long as the emulator can use multiple rompaths).<br>As usual, Logiqx has a better explanation in this <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=retrogen&Number=52246&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post52246">forum post</a>, in his own page and in the MAMEDiff.txt. [sarcasm mode on] However, in no place he mentions that the original idea of the tiny dat was mine :) However, I can agree that he has the small merit of expanding the original idea to cover 24 combinations and to develop the whole algorithm, but the idea was mine in first place :-p [sarcasm mode off]<br>You can try both the utility and some suplementary dats for MAME + Raine/Nebula/Kawaks at <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's homepage</a>.<br>Now I'm running for dinner out and movie session at 1am :)<br>|||1||

This happened cause the man there forgot to keep the old url and someone else registered it (for redirecting to a search engine).

The technicians are a lot of [insert your favorite insult here] cause one full week after, they are *studying* the problem. And they even told me that to get my money back, what I have to do is not use internet while this problem persist. I have to pay another connection so I can search for news and then post here. I can't even do the thing of change permanently cause ALL the ISP's in Spain are equally crappy. So I hope the number of readers INCREASES or I'll start killing people. Some. At least. Maybe. I'm hungry, errr I mean angry.|||1||
1016480433|pi|Fly little bird, fly!|First thing I noticed today is another big update at <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/">The Arcade Flyer Archive</a>. There are 45 classics such as Baby Pac-Man, Frogger, Karate Champ and Zaxxon (from Sleith), and then 9 NeoGeo flyers like Metal Slug 4 and Neo Bomberman (from The Sheep). Cool additions.

1016499543|Logiqx|Manufacturers and a new look|I've been meaning to add a manufacturer index to CAESAR for a long time and today I've finally done it! Even better is that it's all been generated without any intervention from me (not even a hand-typed list of names to search for). Despite MAME having a million and one variants for each manufacturer I came up with a simple but smart algorithm to ascertain all of the top manufacturers (the criteria being at least 10 games in MAME) and generate index pages for them.<br><br>Also updated today is the look of CAESAR, it is now officially stripy! Only a smallish change but the old one was looking a little tired imo.|||1||
1016545143|pi|Small news, long post!|Hey little facelift yesterday here at CAESAR. That manufacturer's list is cool, uh? Maybe sometimes it's not very noticeable but Logiqx always does things here and there to keep CAESAR up and running. There have been some little updates as well in some pages mentioned here lately:<br><br>First, Roman has updated his star application, <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro 2.54d</a>.

(Even me when I said it was 2.54c...)<br><br>XRay1 has returned and said some words of thanks to the donators at <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/">The Arcade Flyers Archive</a>.

1016577937|pi|And even more improvements|Fandemame keeps on it and he has uploaded <a href="http://fandemame.rcroms.com/">History.dat 0.58d</a>.

Including Donkey Kong :) And now something if you don't notice: the news in the page are in english! Thanks guy!|||1||
1016578279|pi|Open your eyes|I hope everyone notices the sentence just below our big logo. It means that if you know of something, then tell us!

So everyone has a happy Spring!<br>(But if you are on Euskalnet you can't read this.)<br>Update: As a change, even when my ISP is still giving me problem, today the tech guy who attended me was more understanding and nice than the others. Now I see the light at the end of the tunnel (and I hope it's not the train going to roll over me).<br>2nd update: And now somehow everything seems to be ok! Let's see how long this lasts!<br><br>Third and last update: No, it's not solved.|||1||
1016699287|Logiqx|Another BIG Enhancement|Seems I'm on a roll at the moment!<br><br>I've added a year index (in between the game and manufacturer indices). <br><br>I've also added all MAME artwork to the game pages (e.g. <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/games/outrun.shtml#outrun">Out Run</a>).

As <a href="http://www.emuhq.com/">PeterD</a> noted, there are some <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/E-Mail/CPS-2.shtml">predictions by Logiqx</a> which I find interesting and quite rational (scroll down to the section "CPS-2 boards with Raz.")<br>However don't take his words as the future, cause in the end, Razoola will do what he thinks it's best :-p|||1||

Not only it comes with improvements like more stability, BMP export... It comes with a full plugin system! Including the SDK, and it works already with CPS-3 images.

I see something for INI's to redefine inputs, it seems its being developed, which would be REALLY good if it follows the same loading scheme as of the normal INI's (general, type, driver, game). No screenshots, but lots of good stuff IMHO, even when half of it is already within MAME ;)|||1||
1016921274|pi|Here it comes!|No man, this is not another you-know-what post. This is a brand new release! The beast is called Zinc, done by the creators of Impact and the S11 preview emu. In fact, S11 + Impact = Zinc. Ths actually means that S11 and Impact are not supported anymore. The first version is <a href="http://www.impactemu.com/">Zinc 0.5</a> and it is available for Linux and *all* Windows flavors. Zinc supports the arcade systems Sony ZN-1 and ZN-2 and Namco System 11. It supports 26 games, 16 have full sound and are fully playable, and only 3 games are not playable. Great!<br>Since this emulator is a predecessor of two others, in its first version it already has "changelog". Well, in short it has fixes, improved performance for both emu and renderer, some new games AND a dynarec with CPU-specific optimizations and configurable performance... Too good!<br>The wait was long, but I feel it was very worth it! I hope everyone enjoys this new hi-tech emulator; congratulations and thanks to the developer team for this jewel.|||1||

1018193170|pi|A big system gets a big post|While CAESAR is an archive and personally I like classic stuff more than recent, lately there are many NeoGeo news. The last one, if you haven't read around, is the availability for emulators of the game Bang Bead, which is the sequel to the also NeoGeo game <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/games/flipshot.shtml">Battle Flipshot</a>.<br><br>How to play the game?

1018193196|pi|First of the day|Now, the man, Logiqx, has updated his two star applications in <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">his homepage</a>. MAMEDiff 1.11 and DatUtil 1.17. These utilities are designed to work with data files. MAMEDiff can spot all the changes between two MAME releases, as well as any differences between two data files in the CMPro/listinfo format. It has many features including spotting renames, the generation of data files with the changes, and tiny dat generation as well.<br><br>On the other side, DatUtil is designed to transform between different data file formats, like RomCenter 1/2, ClrMamePro/Listinfo, Mimic, Nebula *.dat and many more. It can also sport differences (in a lesser way) and detect errors, extract single sets or games, and well, a powerful tool. If you used them already, update yourself.

1018219656|pi|Second of the day|As I prophetized, there would be more rom tools releases today. Two more reached the street. First one happened when Roman released <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro 2.60</a>. The greatest change is the rebuilder, which can work with zips without touching the compressed data, just moving the blocks around. That speeds up things tremendously, like we saw in the WIP. There are some more changes and fixes, this is a quality release, grab it and enjoy!<br><br>The second tool is not for kids, but anyway Logiqx made <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">ZIPIdent 1.0</a> for anyone needing it.

Highlights: Switches to choose controller and rendering plugins, second player added to all drivers, no more strange dynarec tuning switches (so now all games should run at optimal speed), fixed renderers, and more things. It's remarkable the addition of a plugin mini-SDK so hopefully we will see soon some controller plugins, but for now only for the Windows version, Linux users will have to wait a little bit.

It seems the emulation is complete, but it only supports the game Oriental Legend due to protection on other games. I guess it has more new things, but the PGM is big thing enough to keep you entertained for a bit :)<br><b>Update:</b> Forgot to mention some more WIP screenshots of <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/tmp/pgmwip5.htm">Knights of Valour</a>.|||1||

Nicola Salmoria fixed the background graphics in News, David Haywood sent in a preliminary driver for Shadow Force which doesn't yet have sound and there are some graphics glitches, and Aaron Giles fixed a divide by zero error in Dyno Bop and he fixed the alternate Road Blasters set so that inserting coins works again.  There are some new screenshots up up the page as well, so go <a href="http://www.mame.net/status.html">take a look</a>.  Maybe I'll find some more news in the next few hours.  :-)  |||1||
1019414525|pi|Back on the hard work|Time to take on the news after the long weekend out: Mike Haggar has released <a href="">Nebula and Kawaks Transparencies Pack 20020421</a>. This pack has many additions for Strikers 1945 Plus, and three CPS-1 classics: Captain Commando (I actually played this machine this weekend), Forgotten Worlds and Nemo.

1019414576|pi|Sounds good, uh?|M.A.S.H. has posted a source fix for MAME. This little fix affects the Seta Sound system, used for example in the games Zing Zing Zip, Meta Fox, Twin Eagle... Get it at the <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/">M.A.S.H.'s MameInfo page</a>.|||1||

1019509537|pi|Genesis? No, arcade!|On the seventh day, he rested :) After the sunday break, Gridle has posted two days of <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>. This time the addition is called Legend of Silk Road, a '99 game with 3D-ish sprites. Its emulation is far from complete but still playable for what they say. What do they say? Go and read it all!|||1||
1019509561|pi|And another one|Brian has posted a brand new distribution <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/pacmame/">PacTray 7.6 / PacMAME .58 (.NET) FINAL</a>. Nothing has changed on the emulator itself, just for the distribution package which is made now with Windows Installed (hrm). If you had problems with the old package, get this new one. Again. If you dare :-p|||1||
1019595288|pi|Console mode|Time for another <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>. This time is text only, and only one day, but IMHO they are good news, fixing and improving drivers are certainly good news. Walk by there to read what's all about, it includes improvements for yesterday's driver of Legend of Silkroad and the infamous third button in Final Fight :)|||1||
1019597785|pi|Non-MAME|I know I'm a bit behind on MAME versions and related stuff, but right now I'm a bit saturated of it. When 0.60 is released I'll keep up with every version, right now I'm still in semi-holidays mood. Anyway lately there weren't really many news. Let's hope that the lazy mode gets off soon, someone save me from myself!|||1||
1019602132|pi|Too cute to miss it|Lord Evil Elmo amuses me with some cute Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix sprite rips. Get them at <a href="http://cps2burn.emuunlim.com/">CPS2Burn</a>, really when will he put Morrigan's ones????? Oh yes he has other things in his site, like savestates, BEUFE, other sprite rips, but well, no Morrigan = no fun! :)|||1||
1019685316|pi|Who would have imagined it!|Surprise, surprise! <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>! Who would have imagined it, the webslave has posted another day of development of MAME. The devs are getting quite active, maybe it's time for another release :) Until then, you can find in the Work in Progress report some good news such as the addition of several clones for vector games, and the addition of Taxi Driver and Miss Bubble 2, both with wrong colours :)|||1||
1019685357|pi|For me? Really?|Lord Evil Elmo is not only not evil at all, but he took my comment as a request and transformed himself in Lord Nice Elmo and made some Morrigan sprite rips from Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix! Me is pleased, thanks man :) See them while they are fresh at <a href="http://cps2burn.emuunlim.com/">CPS2Burn</a>, where else?|||1||
1019685378|pi|Make-up for everyone|Time for site redesigns. The <a href="http://fba.emuunlim.com/">FinalBurn Alpha site</a> has been "overhauled", and yes now it displays well in my Notescrap 4.7x. As well, <a href="http://www.hanaho.com/">HanaHo</a> has finished its loooong site redesign with lots of new stuff. You can visit both sites by using the magical device found in your hand.|||1||

Guess what, another one with wrong colours :)|||1||
1019691356|pi|Being late but not too late|Looks like I always miss these releases. <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx</a> has updated both MAMEDiff and DatUtil in case a new release comes out. He states he will be busy for "at least the next couple of weeks". I also missed a DatUtil release but well, that's outdated, something about lotsa samples for PinMame. The new stuff deals only with PGM support already included for when it comes with MAME.|||1||
1019772572|pi|Once upon a time...|And another daily dose of <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>! This time it features the screenshots of Xyonix, another tetris added to MAME, it has no controls, no sound, and wrong colours. Great achievement lol :) Well at least better than I can do, and I'm sure it will be fixed as the other screenshots which are from Miss Bubble 2 with right sprite colours.<br><br>And this hasn't been mentioned on the last WIP, but it seems that a very known MAMEdev has emulated CoJag so expect some unexpected huge additions in that area as well. Well if you expect them, then it's not unexpected? What am I saying? You better forget about what I said :)<br>|||1||
1019772630|pi|Dave: the Return (on a screen near you)|This is really a surprise, as Dave has released <a href="http://www.finalburn.com/">FinalBurn 0.510</a>. There are many things to think about this version. Last was 123, this is 510, so did Dave made 387 private versions? Is this just a release to calm down Dave's emulation addiction or is this the first one of a new batch of frequent releases as he did in the past? Don't think this is a small update, it has some good fixes, the addition of some Sega oldies like Golden Axe and Altered Beast, and a bloat of CPS games. However it seems the list is still complete, so I would bet for another release not too far away. Good to see the good work back!<br><br>And now the last question which comes to my mind... And now where this leaves the FinalBurn Alpha development team? Time will tell! :) As a final comment, Logiqx will not release the datafile for this FinalBurn in quite some days, unless a miracle happens. So be patient!|||1||
1019772648|pi|The future is coming|Roman has released <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro 2.61</a> twice, it seems the first one had a little problem. This version has a lot of new things, you better check the changelog to have a glimpse of what to expect in the upcoming releases. Did I read md5 and folder support???|||1||
1019773257|pi|The most arcade-ish frontend in the hood|I usually don't post about frontends unless they are new (like when ZiNc came around) or when they have something real different to offer to us. And <a href="http://www.i-modernist.com/emulaxian/">Emulaxian 0.60</a> has been released, does the name tell you something? :-p Thanks again to <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">the usual site</a> for the good news.|||1||
1019777471|pi|Not so Finally-Burned-Out|Lord Evil Elmo (aka the fluffy Elmo) has conducted an interview with Dave, the FinalBurn author, which explains a bit about the future of FinalBurn and the present release. It's available at <a href="http://cps2burn.emuunlim.com">CPS2Burn</a>, in the Emu-X section. Very interesting I would say. |||1||
1019853395|pi|One per day is more than enough|Another day, another <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro 2.61a</a>. There are some fixes from yesterday's release, plus some "major speedup". So today we have ClrMamePro, where's the MAME WIP???<br>|||1||
1019853420|pi|Advance level|Time for a change, <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/">AdvancePac 0.58.0</a> is the AdvanceProjects target for <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/pacmame/">PacMAME</a>. So if you want to run all kinds of Pac-Man in all kinds of video modes, this is your choice I guess. Binary for DOS/Pentium and sources available. There's also an updated AdvanceMENU v1.18.1 with AdvancePAC support, of course.|||1||
1019858523|pi|A personal favorite|Somehow I stumbled upon (on? at? in?) <a href="http://www.klov.com/Q/Quake_-_Arcade_Tournament_Edition.html">this Quake KLOV entry</a>. Since I don't like the second part nor the "Arena" one, I found it very interesting. I guess that you all Quake and arcade lovers will find nice to know about the existence of this prototype. Will it be ever added to MAME? Ah yes, in 2006 :)|||1||
1019943929|pi|So much info|WTC has updated again <a href="http://emustatus.rainemu.com/">Emulation Status</a>. This one is a rather big update, and he writes a bit about this and that, mentioning some boards going to be dumped soon, hopefully, as well as a "name that game" request with a laserdisc game. An interesting short read anyway, and you can also find updates and new additions for nearly 100 games. Names? Strikers 1945 series, Marble Madness 2, Thunder Hoop series, Puzz Loop series, and well too many more.|||1||
1019943973|pi|One day off and we already missed it...|After ausence yesterday, <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> has arrived again with two days of development courtesy of Gridle.

Created by Vaz and maintained by some staff, it's an archive of captures from arcade games in MAME, and the captures are nothing else than endings.

1020029397|pi|This time it's short|We're back on the daily updates of <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>. This time it's a short one but there are colorful screenshots of Hyper PacMan. Like M.A.S.H. says, "another [Maze] from [Haze]". More than a PacMan clone, it looks to me like a PacMania clone.

1020119800|pi|Everyone's hero|There's a small update at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/">Aaron's Home Page</a>. I'm glad to hear that he's working on a new artwork handling system for MAME, which for me is something good cause the current one is driving me nuts. He explains a bit of what he's doing right now (a bit of RLS it seems) and the updates on the To-do list and his MAME log. Certainly this last piece, the MAME log, is really impressive.|||1||
1020119840|pi|Artists wanted?|Roman a.k.a Bogy has released <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro 2.62</a>, with the usual batch of fixes and speedups. He also asks for different buttons if you don't like the new ones, just go to the front page and read.|||1||
1020119905|pi|Still not frozen|Dave has released <a href="http://www.finalburn.com/">FinalBurn 0.514</a>. The changelog is not so long this time, but it has a couple of good things (and one bad). It also features a new .DAT file export, so you can get your own datafiles. I've heard he had help from Logiqx himself so the datafile should be OK I guess :) And an important thing is that now FinalBurn should run on almost any Windows flavor, but as usual, your mileage will vary.|||1||
1020119922|pi|They have a new home|The Drunken Muppets are up again on <a href="http://www.emuhype.com/">emuhype.com</a>, their new website. Impactemu.com was no longer valid, and this one took a bit to come, but it's here finally. Still below one thousand visits, so go and shake that counter...|||1||
1020119934|pi|Eye candies|Kazuya has made available some more <a href="http://www.neogeoforlife.com/">inserts from his last competition</a>, high quality stuff I would say. I don't print them but I've got a couple just cause they are cute things to put instead of snaps and cabinets... Also he tells a bit of hints about printing the inserts and some stickers, go check them out if you're into these things.|||1||
1020119948|pi|State-of-the-art port|<a href="http://www.macmame.org/">MacMAME 0.59</a> is available already, it has some OS X fixes and an improvement in one of the cores making the Taito F3 games work much better. If you're on Mac, get your MacMAME while it's hot!|||1||
1020119968|pi|Story.dat|Fandemame has made a new update on the <a href="http://fandemame.emu-france.com/">official History.dat 0.59a</a>, which adds many more information tidbits for about 30 games. It also has the return of the Tips and Tricks section, for mmmmmmh one, two thre... Wow, too many games to count :) Tips and tricks for Tetris? That's something I have to read ;)|||1||
1020119987|pi|And the last bit|Guess what? <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>! One day! :) Well, in short, let's see what we can find here. Oh, "Psykio SH-2" and "speedup" in the same sentence? Wow! And finally, a Great 1000 Miles Rally 2 driver, submitted by Stephane Humbert. Unfortunately it seems that there's a missing rom or a bad dump. This update is juicy, more things to read on you-know-where.|||1||
1020199732|pi|A different twist|Gridle talks a bit about the upcoming new MAME FAQ in <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamefaq&Number=160">this forum post</a>. Basically it's the last request for correction and additions before the WIP becomes the official FAQ. So if you want to help the project a bit, you know where to go. Thanks to <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MameWorld</a> for the info.|||1||
1020199769|pi|Back on daily updates?|And another release: <a href="http://www.finalburn.com/">FinalBurn 0.515</a>. It's good to see back Dave on the works, this version has some fixes and what seems to be the beginning of road emulation in Thunderblade. There is also a new game called Royal Ascot 2, but for what he says, not playable at all. Remember to read the <a href="http://www.finalburn.com/finalburn.txt">documentation</a>! Note that to the best of my knowledge, the <a href="http://fblinux.emuunlim.com/">FinalBurn for Linux</a> project is still orphan.|||1||
1020286179|pi|Good day for the emulation community|If as reading this you think you are reading the last news of the day, you're wrong. Here in CAESAR the last news are in the top, so you have to learn to read backwards from the last news you saw here. I say this cause I try to be careful about the order of the news, and tonight there are many juicy news. Stay tuned as I write them all!|||1||
1020287069|pi|For the hard wait...|May 1st, internationally recognized as Day of the Worker (or something similar depending of the country). Maybe due to that Nicola has chosen today to release the long awaited <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME 0.60 "Attack of the PROMs"</a>.<br><br>As a curious thing, all the added games have appeared on the WIP, there are no "ghost" entries. Primal Rage, Tactician, Taxi Driver, Judge Dredd, the Outfoxies (finally) and Oriental Legend are all there among other names which should sound familiar to you already, up to a total count of 26 games. There are also 20 new clones of existing games, which is a good count for me :) Oh, no CoJag games as I imagined, maybe in the next release...<br><br>There are also lots of fixes which improve greatly the playability of certain games; namely Batsugun, Hot Chase and Wec Le Mans 24 to mention some. There are a total of 16 MAME Testers bugs fixed, at least mentioned there, as usual there might be more. All the details are in the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html">whatsnew.txt</a> file, so read it while you download the biggest arcade emulator. Happy playing! (But hold your breath cause the day hasn't finished yet!)<br>|||1||
1020287092|pi|More gifts for today|Another big release on the same day, this time at <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock</a>. Razoola has released XOR's for the following games:<ul><li>Night Warriors (USA 950406)</li><li>Vampire Hunter (Japan 950316)</li><li>Vampire Hunter (Japan 950302)</li><li>Dungeons & Dragons (Hispanic 940125)</li></ul>The set Night Warriors/Vampire Hunter is new so all of you Vampire fans (me likes Morrigan of course!) will be pleased. Raz has also posted CPS2Mame v2.591 to support these releases, it's also available at <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock</a> as usual. Happy playing again! (And also the same recommendation cause there's still more for tonight.)|||1||
1020287137|pi|The last member of the breed|As we are used, after a XOR there's always a new version of one of my personal favorites, so here it comes <a href="http://kawaks.retrogames.com/">Kawaks 1.43</a> courtesy of MHz. There are loads of new things, of course the addition of the latest XOR's and Bang Bead too. There are some fixes to other sets as well but you should really have no probs with these changes, I think the only new roms are the NeoPong 1.1 which are available at the NeoDev homepage.<br><br>This version also comes with many graphic improvements like Smart Interframe Blending and the new KScale blitter, similar to the 2xSAi and SuperEagle, but looking much better and way too faster :) There are also many fixes and speedups here and there, really this release looks very good to me. Now yes, it seems that that's all for today so happy playing! :)|||1||
1020287155|pi|Not any less important|Oh I almost forgot the <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Nebula</a> users, sorry! There's no new release, but Razoola has posted at <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock</a> a new set of DATS for Nebula to support the latest releases, so you can go there to download it to use them with your current Nebula. Uh, am I forgetting anything? Ah yes, happy playing!|||1||
1020287190|pi|And finally, the beginning|And today there's already some <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> for your pleasure. It seems these changes were posted before today's release, so they seem to be included in 0.60. At least the development of yesterday should be there, and Dragon Punch (today's screenshots) is mentioned in the new clones list :) Other things in the WIP as usual, give them a try. Phew, no more things for today as there is enough!|||1||
1020288874|pi|The Newerending Story :)|Well since I'm still here downloading, I guess I could report the following fact: Starring an early update, <a href="http://mac.emuhq.com/cpsmame/">CPSMAME 5.1.02</a> already has today's XOR's, and at least the Carbon version is based on the MacMAME 0.59 core. Unfortunately the Classic version will be based on 0.56a from now on as it seems to be more stable on OS 8/9.|||1||
1020377101|pi|Bad food, bad|Tonight I'm pretty sick, so no news. I want to mention that Logiqx is busy right now to do the dats, but he's slowly going thru the whole process and he will release them when they are ready, but please be patient. Worth mentioning: <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/">M.A.S.H.</a> has released the MAMEInfo.dat 4.00, the compile package, PCB's, and FixMAME32 release 1, so don't forget about all of them.

1020466171|Logiqx|Quick Fly By!|As if by magic, CAESAR is now up to date with the latest MAME ROMs and information (as always, many games in other emulators needed remapping to the new standards). About 870 pages changed with this rebuild.|||1||
1020468753|pi|Double halfway back|I am still sick, but since Logiqx which is very busy got time and energy to update the dats, I guess I could at least mention it! Let's begin to enumerate them: MAME 0.60 and changes, dats for the new Nebula, Kawaks and Final Burn (including two more supplements today), and updated too many other dats to reflect changes in MAME such as CPS2, Neo-Geo, Nebula Jukebox, etc. John IV has also updated datafiles for Snaps, Icons and Cabinets for MAME.<br><br>All these datafiles are available for/at <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro</a> and <a href="http://www.romcenter.com/">RomCenter</a>. But seriously, if you want to get something, get it from the source, <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's homepage, where good datafiles are laid to rest</a>. ;)<br><br>However for what I understand he might be away for a bit more unless something severe is spotted in the datafiles. As well as me cause I'm back to bed :/ Unless I find something interesting in the next 2 minutes :-p|||1||
1020469172|pi|Uh found it!|Here it is the interesting tidbit I was trying to find: <a href="http://www.finalburn.com/">Final Burn 0.516</a>. Two fixes for G-Loc (new roms so maybe the emulation improves soon!) andThunderblade (no more random crashes), I think those are two enough reasons to update :)|||1||
1020470641|pi|I can't figure out a headline for this|Mike Haggar has released <a href="http://haggar.emuunlim.com/">THE Cheat Files 0.2.6.C</a> for Final Burn Alpha, MAME, Kawaks and Nebula. There are new cheats for the new XOR'ed games, and more cheats for others, mmmmmmmmmmmm for example in mmmmmmmmm Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix :) Yes I don't feel too well but I'm soooooo bored :-p So not in my best shape, I hope you don't mind if I write something silly.

1020513209|pi|The MAME Oracle|The <a href="http://www.mame.net/">Official MAME site</a> has been updated with the new screenshots, and also with something we saw comeing: the new FAQ. It has been revamped and changed the version number from 4.0 to 0.60 (good idea). You can go and read it for your doubts or contribute to it if you see something wrong or missing or incomplete. What I find strange is that they don't mention the FAQ forum! :)|||1||
1020513224|pi|Fuzzy logic|One of the things I missed last night was the release of <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Nebula 2.13</a>.

1020513282|pi|Nothing to do with canadians in the end|This is one of the MAME versions I noticed lately, and they are now up to date with MAME 0.60. <a href="http://go.to/nmamex">CANAME 0.60.1</a> is available for japanese and english audiences, CANAME stands for Cps And Neogeo Arcade Machine Emulator and has so much new stuff that I would not be able to know where to start from.

They have added silently some more flyers to the database since the last frontpage update. Latest names I read are Ridge Racer, Virtua Fighter, Baby PacMan...

The rest of the three days is there for you to discover it.|||1||

Today you can read about Sega System 16, Taito F3, the DEC8 and Funky Jet drivers... I prefer quantity over quality, and this shows quality :)|||1||
1020807152|pi|X-ray glasses auto-enabler|ElSemi has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Nebula 2.13a</a>, a bugfix release with two extras: what seems to be a very good new blitter called SuperScale, and auto-transparencies. I'm getting addicted to play with blitters lately, but then I always go back to play "the real thing". But gotta try this one!|||1||
1020807207|pi|Big news, I said big and good!|The day has come and <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/">CottAGE</a> has seen the light for first time! This new arcade emulator is the creation of Erik Duijs (JEmu) and Julien 'Gollum' Frelat (xxxCott), and it's the Java counterpart of MAME. It's not a port tho the authors say that it's based on MAME. As they say in the page, <i>"CottAGE aims to be the java equal of MAME in terms of compatibility, speed and features"</i>.<br><br>The first release is 0.01, and is already speedy even in my old turtle. It supports 23 games (expect more in further releases) like Space Invaders, Solomon's key, The Glob, Black Tiger and many more classics. Many of them with the label of "100% perfect" :) And some with a 2x mode to allow you to play a bit better.<br><br>The only drawback by now is the ausence of sound, but I really hope they will add it soon. As a novelty, the emulator is downloadable besides being playable online, with source available as well, so maybe you will want some Java :) Congrats and thanks Erik and Julien for such a good work. Solomon rules!|||1||

1022193479|pi|Advanced fixes|Another day, and <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/">AdvanceMAME Version 0.60.1</a> is out. There are a few fixes in this release, and the curious thing of having the pause key disabled, if I've read it well... :-? And as usual there is a new release of its companion AdvanceMENU v1.18.3.|||1||
1022193496|pi|Wallpaper anyone?|Xul8t0r has added votes for his <a href="http://haggar.emuunlim.com/desktop/">NewNet #CPS2Shock (and others) Desktops page</a>. However you can't vote for my wallpaper cause mine is not emu related :( I still think it's the most beautiful one, o'cos! If you think the same, grab it in the little <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/bgr.html">Rose Wallpaper page</a> (to give it a name :-p).|||1||
1022193545|pi|So busy!|Logiqx released the datafiles for Nebula 2.14b with the small note of "better late than never" and also "busy, busy, busy" which also matches with one of the last comments I heard from him, "insanely busy". Hey dude, calm down! Get the datafile at <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's homepage</a>, both for <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/clrmame/">ClrMamePro</a> and <a href="http://www.romcenter.com/">RomCenter</a>.<br><br>And on a side note, I missed the releases of MameDiff 1.13 and DatUtil 1.20, update yourself please! I wish he would just tell me these things! He also told me by email (just right now!) that he updated all the <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/mac.shtml">CAESAR Mac stuff</a> with the missing emulators, thanks to Tim from Arcadecollecting.com.|||1||
1022259491|pi|Work always in Progress|<a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> was also updated today. There are some relevant things from the last three days. One is Dessert Assault being submitted by Brian McPhail, with some colorful screenshots. Zsolt Vasvari also made the submission of Mr. Kougar (again colorful snaps). To end with submissions, Farfetch'd sent in Grand Strike, again with guess what. However, don't think that new games are the only good thing, cause Stepph fixed things, Aaron fixed things and lots of people fixed things, and there are other things added, improved, fixed and... Well, MAME is always changing!|||1||
1022259524|pi|Can you feel it coming?|Tux has updated the <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/html/wip.html">RAINE WIP</a> with the latest changes made before the inminent release of RAINE 0.35a. These changes include some improvements to the GUI (making it smarter and easier to select a game) and some region codes for GunBird and Sengoku Ace. Am I missing something? Ah, yes, Tux says when the release will be made :)|||1||
1022259539|pi|It marks the difference|M.A.S.H. has made a diff-only update, so if you want to have the newest WIP and latest bugs up to today, then download <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/">MameInfo.dat 4.04 diff</a>.|||1||
1022259676|pi|Something else for a change|Yesterday, the spanish Prince of Asturias Research award has been granted to the fathers of Internet: Lawrence G. Roberts, Robert Kahn, Vinton Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee, for what the judges said to be "a definite improvement to the service of the humankind". There also was aknowledgement for John Postel who made possible domain management and died some years ago. The Prince of Asturias Research award is something like the spanish Nobel.<br><br>Alejandro Jodorowsky (1929), famous comic creator among other things (and co-author of the Incal), talks about videogames in an interview made just yesterday: "They are new ways of creation, of expanding the mind. We aren't paying attention to them but they are changing the mind of young people. They are an art which is not understood by adults." Now we only need some of those "adults" to realize it as well :)<br><br>Sorry for the bad translations :) Thanks to my newspaper for the news :-p|||1||
1022286514|pi|As it was prophetized|It's already here, <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">RAINE 0.35a</a>. I go to see Episode II and when I come back I get this, what a wonderful night! As Tux says, this is a quality released. There are no new games (except a few clones), but there is a load of fixes and improvements here and there. The changelog is big, if I could find it :) The DOS users should wait just a bit for the binary, Linux users have to build it by themselves with the sources this time and Windows users have it there and ready. Enjoy the weekend!|||1||
1022337116|pi|Obsessive-compulsive snapping|Logiqx has kindly updated all the <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/multi/kawaks.shtml">CAESAR's Kawaks game pages</a> with my fresh new screenshots of all the games from this emulator. They include title screens, alternate/japanese title screens, selection screens and ingame shots (total 1,033 snaps). I'm back at snapping and I hope this will make CAESAR a bit better database. Next step: Don't know! First I want to distribute the snaps for frontends and the Kawaks GUI when I search/find a host... Then Maybe MAME, maybe RAINE, but not Nebula now since for now I'm tired of Neo-Geo and CPS!|||1||
1022337333|pi|WIP: Web Insistently uPdated|Time for another dose of <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>. Gridle has posted another one-day WIP, with again Aaron fixing the new artwork functions... Well I think when it sees the light it will be rock solid! Nicola emulated the 053936 chip which renders the 3D graphics in Golfing Greats, tho the game is still not playable. There are more things worth reading about Macross Plus, PGM and... Go read!|||1||
1022337396|pi|Mazzoleni goes far and beyond|Andrea released <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/">AdvanceSCAN 1.0</a>. This is the first version of a command line rom manager for MAME, MESS and RAINE (and of course  his AdvanceMAME/MESS), under DOS and Unix. It has the basic functionality of other rom managers, with some extras. Sources are available, as well as the DOS binary. Certainly something to try.|||1||
1022337870|pi|Here too|<a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">RAINE 0.35a</a> has been released for DOS too. Have you updated yourself? What are you waiting for!|||1||
1022419119|pi|Knight of Emulation|ElSemi has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Nebula 2.15</a> with two great additions: Knights of Valour and Knights of Valour Plus have been added, and a preliminar sound emulation in PGM is supported. How preliminar? Well sound effects are not complete yet and there's no music, but it's a start... There is also a fix for netplay of the newly added Konami and PGM games, so be sure to get this last piece of work from ElSemi!|||1||
1022419133|pi|And already there|Another daily <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> courtesy of Gridle. It's no surprise that Kings of Valour has been added thanks to the information provided by ElSemi, however there is no mention to sound in PGM :-? There are screenshots of Indoor Soccer and Sankokushi too, and other nuts & bolts of the development. The source of information is waiting!|||1||
1022419147|pi|WIP directly from the source|The man responsible for all the artwork changing and bugs cleaning, the almighty Aaron Giles :) has updated after almost a month his page. If you head over to <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/">Aaron's Home Page</a>, you will find some nice and certainly impressive artwork sample snaps, which I highly recommend to watch with your own eyes. They do not only include artwork examples, but some emulation improvements too. He has also updated his to-do list and his log, and note that the artwork system is marked as done! And finally he says about something new and non-MAME which could happen soon... Mmmmmmmmm...|||1||
1022419555|pi|Before leaving, I have to tell you something...|I thought he wouldn't have time, since today he's off for a week, but surprise surprise, Logiqx made the Nebula 2.15 dats, which will give a relief to certain people. Strange enough, he hasn't released the RAINE 0.35a ones :( Or maybe it's that the dat doesn't change? Well, patience, in the meanwhile get the dat from <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's page</a>.|||1||
1022448365|pi|CANAME goes another round|There is a new release, <a href="http://go.to/nmamex">CANAME 0.60.6</a>, which fixes various bigs and adds some things for the UI. Mainly a maintenance release, but if this is your choice, then update.|||1||
1022448414|pi|Knight of Updates|ElSemi makes a minor update and releases <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">Nebula 2.15a</a>. The small changes are some sprite problems in KOV being fixed, and changing the rom names of the PGM roms to match MAME.<br><br>Since Nebula supports loading by crc, you can still use <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's dat for 2.15</a> if only the names of the roms have changed, which I should check (but lazy to). Nebula will still locate the correct roms. That will do until Logiqx returns :)<br><br><b>Update:</b> Well the game names have changed but a simple manual rename should work. Read the file HISTORY.TXT to get the new names.|||1||
1022532776|pi|Those are not bamboo|Gridle keeps it up with the <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> and posted another one for today. The snaps are from Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye, submitted by Bryan McPhail. It seems to be a nice shangai/taipei game from 1992. There are a couple of things more, but I'm lazy to comment... Check'em by yourself.|||1||
1022532835|pi|Different address, same quality|Roman has moved to <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/"><b>www.clrmame.com</b></a>. Now this famous and powerful rom manager has its own domain. The host is the same, but the door looks much better now :) Btw the old url doesn't work anymore! Roman, congrats on your own domain and keep up the good work!|||1||
1022532886|pi|Are you on celebs?|<a href="http://emu-celebs.consollection.com/">Emu-Celebs</a> has opened its doors. It's a joint effort between Ben-J, Gollum, Leto II and Rico2000, and well, you should check it. Pay attention to the "insert coins" warning and to the walking Mario :)<br><br>The first celeb on the software authors section is Logiqx, which is a great dude, too bad he's out and can't see the opening... There are sections for all the people in the emulation community, including news posters :) I'm not there yet, and I don't plan to be since I don't think I have too much to say... yet.|||1||
1022534952|pi|Colorful media|I've received an email today telling me about <a href="http://www.emophoto.com/em/~mcdart/mamelabels.htm">Project MCDArt</a>, that's MAME CD Art, or simply speaking, some cool cd labels for your MAME disks. Try them! I don't have a printer :(|||1||
1022621518|pi|No, it's not "Canada" MAME|After a short time, <a href="http://go.to/nmamex">CANAME 0.60.7</a> has been released. The changes come from another MAME variant, StretchMAME. The blitters, fixed inputs and better FPS showing come from it, but this one is CANAME, that's CPS and Neo-Geo only.<br>|||1||
1022621591|pi|The emu you would want as gf|Everyone's favorite Laserdisc emulator (or for what's it, the only one), has been updated with another pre-release. <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~redflame/daphne/">DAPHNE v0.99.5pre3 (May 27th, 2002)</a> is up there to download for i386, Windows flavors and Linux test builds.

1022622452|pi|It's RAINEing|<a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">RAINE 0.35b</a> is a quick bugfix of what they forgot in the last version :) There are some changes which give more stability and usability, specially that -gameinfo crash, thanks Emmanuel. And Stephh also updated the cheats! So, you know, today's orders are "update, update and update"!|||1||
1022709267|pi|New make-up|One of the first things I noticed today was the total look change in <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MameWorld</a>! This new one is cool, faster, and all that. KillerClown has made a good job and you should let him now! Congrats man, great work!|||1||
1022709286|pi|New issue out|"The best MAME magazine around", otherwise known as <a href="http://mamemag.mameworld.net/">MAMEMag</a> has moved to <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MameWorld</a>. To "celebrate" it, issue #2 is out, with lots of reviews and things. Not available in PDF yet but be patient... Wasn't it "biweekly"?|||1||
1022709341|pi|New news|Roman has left things temporarily and taken some deserved vacations, but he has left a little preview of what's going to come to <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/">ClrMamePro</a>...|||1||
1022709357|pi|New art|If you want to have a look of what will be on the inminent Aaron's artwork system, head over to <a href="http://www.macmame.net/artcade/">Artcade</a> where you can see lots of artwork and backdrops. It seems the artwork will be provided in a new format, so we will see. I think I saw all this in a thread started by Fandemame so thanks to him :)|||1||
1022709370|pi|New version|Everyone's favorite mameinfo.dat maker, that's M.A.S.H. (oh sorry he's the only one) has updated it once again. <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/">MameInfo.dat 4.05</a> is there with bugs up to today, with the newest WIP and oh surprise! He has added the release dates of 60 machines more, thanks to Yasuhiro Ogawa... Keep helping him on this quest!<br><br><b>Update:</b> Personal thanks to Stiletto for his always exact corrections :)|||1||
1022789478|pi|Two letters and two albums|I have received an email from Raix, the editor of <a href="http://mamemag.mameworld.net/">MAMEMag</a>, that MAMEMag's intention is to be bi-weekly; however the issue of mid-june will be skipped due to other tasks (site redesign and so on), so my question was answered: Definitely it's bi-weekly.<br><br>Also thanks to Stiletto who also wrote me about the confusion about release dates of arcade machines. Getting emails spotting errors in my posts is something which makes me happy: it improves the quality and it shows me that people actually read what I write :)<br><br>Other than that, today I seem to be unable to find some news so I'm going to make a pause and just fade away until tomorrow. Don't worry, I'll use my time listening to Jarre's Akropolis concert while waiting for the new album by Oldfield...|||1||
1022881960|pi|Everybody's doing it so why can't we?|Like he says, everyone else is doing it, so here it's <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/tourniquet/wip/">Tourniquet's Official Unnoficial WIP</a> for your viewing pleasure. It shows alpha blending in the Psikyo SH-2 driver, and looks cool certainly. Let's hope he finishes it and submits soon!|||1||
1022885126|pi|Well...|Am I in low shape or what? Today I seem to be lost in space or something. Some RLS and LOM don't help either with finding something interesting to post about. I don't know if tomorrow I'll be here, so maybe another day without news?<br><br>Whatever happens, today I don't have even an alternative, non-arcade link or subject to talk about. Did anyone said empty head? :-p|||1||
1022932020|pi|Grand opening today - bring the kids|Gazoo has opened today <a href="http://trc.retrogames.com/">The Review Center</a>, the sucessor of his old NRC, but now more generic - and more big. Of course I like reviews and I like green so let's use the fireworks and let's command the orchestra to play at full volume! For now he has only added NeoGeo games, and the site is ready for you to sign up and all that (btw nice design dude). Let's do some reviews! Thanks to Gazoo himself for his kind letter :)|||1||
1022940841|pi|Making history a couple of times per month|Fandemame makes the first release of this sunny saturday: <a href="http://fandemame.emu-france.com/">History.dat 0.60a</a>. There are infos added for fifty or sixty games, or more... At least 56 are listed and then "several others". There are tips and tricks added for 15 games too, so be sure to be up to date with the dats.|||1||
1022940870|pi|status good color good sound preliminary|The master of <a href="http://emustatus.rainemu.com/">Emulation Status</a>, known as WTC, has updated it. As usual, the text of the update also contains juicy tidbits you shouldn't miss ;) And this time he focused more on providing accurate information than in increasing it. There are twenty new games, but he has updated and removed many more games, with correct names and information. The truth is out there! And now, also in Emustatus :)|||1||
1022940891|pi|When will they come?|<a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/">Guru's Rom Dumping News</a> has some more juicy stuff to read about. Short but nice, Guru has received two games for dumping. Tekken 2 and Osman, if you want to know. If not, too late, you've read it :-p|||1||
1022940914|pi|Today's second surprise|After a loooong time without any update, actually one year and one week, I'm surprised to see the release of <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX 1.21</a>. This is the toy which makes the MAME executable to be 3megs and not 13 :) But it's used widely in many other emulators and tools, from Kawaks to DatUtil, so hey all developers out there, don't miss this! Note that this is mainly a maintenance release for the source more than for the program's functionality, except a new and better compression method which all the compilers out there will use for sure to save some bandwidth for their servers ;)|||1||
1022959349|pi|Icons made clear|After all the fuss about <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/icons/">Mamu_'s Icons</a> being updated with the icons for MAME 0.60, and them being missing in action, all is clear. They are certainly missing in action (from Mamu_'s page that's it), so KillerClown has posted them in the front page of <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MameWorld</a>, available for all us Windows users who prefer Mamu_'s collection. Chris also posted the other day <a href="http://tkmame.retrogames.com/icons/">Mamu_'s icons for X</a>.|||1||
1022978539|pi|Was it what it was?|I was missing something, but <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> is already here for our enjoyment. The last five days of develompent are quite solid, I can smell the next release coming soon :) Since it's a long update, you better go there and read by yourself, and enjoy the nice pictures of Dragonball Z 2 and Run & Gun (very preliminar), and again Tourniquet's alpha blending pictures. Other proper names are there for you to know.|||1||
1023036346|pi|Want to fight better?|Another hardware thing to plug on your computer/whatever and smack up some opponents in your favorite emulator: <a href="http://www.slikstik.com/fighter.htm">SlikStik Fighter</a>. Once you see the picture everything is more clear, so if you are rich, you might want to check it out :) Thanks (once again) to <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/">MameWorld</a> for the tip.|||1||
1023036563|pi|Small step for MASH but a giant leap...|Lately more and more devs are making pre-wips, and M.A.S.H. repeats it with a driver for Vs. Raid on Bungeling Bay, for the Nintendo VS system. You can see and get <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/wip/">pics and driver</a>. In the forum, OG said it was too much of a hack, so it's not clear if it will go into MAME as it is or not. For me it would be ok, a hacked driver is the first step to emulate protection, as an example take CPS-2 and the XOR files :-p|||1||
1023037196|pi|Developing for the future|More <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> for today, this guy is fast when he wants... Dragonball Z 2 gets rights colours, and Red Robin has been submitted. For the rest, go ahead...|||1||
1023052522|pi|Ave Caesar|Triumphally triumphant, Logiqx has come back from his campaigns in Britannia, Germania, Hispania and any other "ania". It seems with renewed energies since he has released dats for the latest Nebula, Raine and Laser over at <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's page</a>, as well as updated CAESAR with all the stuff, and he had even time to say "hi" to me and notify me of all this :)|||1||
1023137062|pi|Flying start|After almost one month, <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/">The Arcade Flyers Archive</a> breaks the silence (be sure to read the update) and adds flyers for nine games, like Soul Edge and Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom. Nice artwork :)|||1||
1023137076|pi|Unchain my drivers|And another <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> for today. It's plenty of colorful screenshots, from X-Day 2, Beast Busters, Mechanized Attack (all of them new submissions) and Quiz Sailor Moon (cute fixed colors). As usual my advice is to go to the source and read it all :-p|||1||
1023137090|pi|Little but still|After some time of rest, there are new things on <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/pacmame/">PacMAME</a>. Only one game added, the Falcom (Falcon?) version of Pacman, but well it's a start. I hope to see it back on our download managers soon :)|||1||
1023137105|pi|If you're worried about...|Triggerfin has updated <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/catlist/">CATList</a> with a WIP redesign, and he has also added a file for the Mame Content Manager. Beware it deletes roms!|||1||
1023137121|pi|Return from the netherworlds|It seems today it's the day of returns. Another one is Kazuya who has updated twice <a href="http://www.neogeoforlife.com/">Neogeoforlife.com</a>. There is some good stuff for NeoGeo lovers, like more inserts for KOF from the competition, a movie from Rage of the Dragons and well... Not going to spoil all the surprises!<br>|||1||
1023143806|pi|Java emu eaten by roman emperor|Logiqx has released the datafiles for CottAGE and added it to CAESAR as well. What an... mmmm.... energetic return :) Get them at <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's homepage</a> of course.|||1||
1023216840|pi|EmuStatus 101%|Shortly after his last update, WTC has changed again <a href="http://emustatus.rainemu.com/">Emulation Status</a>, with a dozen (uhm actually 11) changes he couldn't make in the earlier update. As he mentions, the update is not very big but anyway I guess you're not done with the last one anyway, so keep digging in this big site.|||1||
1023216858|pi|More windows and more windows...|Roman is back in town and to prove it he has released <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/">ClrMamePro 2.65</a>. It contains a new "setinformation" window which is handy to get an overview of a certain set in a quick way. There are a handful of other new/fixed/improved things, so get your update at his still shining new domain :)|||1||
1023217284|pi|A world around MAME|There is a new home for <a href="http://zmame.mameworld.net">ZMAME</a>, the MAME port for the Zaurus PDA.

1023217615|pi|Fresh as everyday bread|Seems we are back again to the daily <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>. Which is good indeed, these devs work hard :) There are pics of three submitted games: Kiki Ippatsu Mayumi-chan, Jump Kids and The Next Space. There were two more submissions but no pics of them (one doesn't work). So head there to read the full story.|||1||

1023311957|pi|Monthly releases?|Despite the date mentioned in the page, The Beaver has released today (and not a month ago) <a href="http://mimic.arcadeheaven.com/">Mimic 2.04</a>. It seems that the new things are again mostly for consoles, but there is a new 6502 core. Anyway we don't need too many excuses to update, right?|||1||
1023312009|pi|As much info as you can handle|Another big update, Fandemame seems to have accumulated lots of information, he has released <a href="http://fandemame.emu-france.com/">History.dat 0.60b</a> with tons of new additions, also in the tip & tricks section.

1023393474|pi|Some more to drool...|Aaron Giles updated his site with more teasers for the upcoming new artwork system. These look very good, they are from 1943, Commando and Mad Planets. I wonder how many of these .art packs we will have to get on the release day, but I don't mind if they are a hundred, certainly look great! Oh well, see them at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/">Aaron's Home Page</a>, that's right.|||1||
1023398084|pi|Housekeeping|Logiqx has made some maintenance on CAESAR. He has added a new PS2 section (for the X-MAME port), added zMAME, updated a variety of things and made a general clean-up. Now CAESAR is as usual: shining as new.|||1||
1023406897|pi|wapwepWIPwopwup|The <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> has just been updated with the last two days of hard development of the developers... At least the *visible* development :) The pics aren't anything spectacular, they are from the submitted games called Super Ten, Super Duper Casino and the more colorful Legion.

Since Brad updated MacMAME, this CPS-only version was updated as well, trying to adapt the current package to the 0.60's features (like a better HID support).

The last seven days of development have been finally made public, full of nice news. My advice is as usual to read it by yourself, it has a bit from everything, from Monte Carlo (Atari 1979) to Battle Backraid (Raizing 1999), going thru more games, fixes, improvements and everything... These MAMEDevs are great guys indeed! I think we will have a nice weekend ;)|||1||
1024005813|pi|Testers Square|Smitdogg has also been a kind dude and updated <a href="http://www.mametesters.com/">MAME Testers</a>, more specifically the Orange Files section.

Sagaia!<br><br>That's pretty much about it since everyone is holding their breath for 0.61 it seems... Even me!

There was a new beta released, and the sources were made available according to the MAME license. There have been some testimonies about the playability of this port and most of them agree that it's probably the most solid port to a big console. Nothing strange since the X-Box is actually a PC overdeformed for games, which could be perfect except for a little memory problem. So go and enjoy if you can! I don't have one, so I accept donations in form of Dreamcasts, PlayStations (one or two) and X-Box. I'd accept even a Saturn ;) Thanks to Prophet for the url tip.|||1||

1025041622|pi|Sad news|Unfortunately the <a href="http://www.spies.com/arcade/">Arcade Game Collector's Archive</a> has closed down, due to excessive leeching. Sad thing. Let's hope it resurrects somewhere else since all that info seems to be in dozens of computers :/ Thanks to <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=80129&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post80129">Greg</a> for the information.|||1||
1025128341|pi|Third attempt is the successful|<a href="http://xbox.mame.net/">MAME-X beta 3</a> with some good fixes which makes this port much better to use. Again, no one wants to donate me a console so I can test all these ports? :)|||1||
1025128408|pi|Or fourth...|There is a new preview release of your favorite Laserdisc emulator: <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~redflame/daphne/">DAPHNE v0.99.5pre4 (June 25th, 2002) for i386 Windows NT/2000/XP (test build)</a>. As usual I don't know what's new but I expect fixes and improvements. Even a little small one. It's always good to be up-to-date (except with m$ products).|||1||
1025128434|pi|Everyday's bread|More <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/">CottAGE WIP</a>. This time Gollum added M79 Ambush and Erik added Radar Scope. This will not be a small emulator, indeed! Anyone said Mortal Kombat on Java? :)|||1||
1025128500|pi|Two minute warning|Roman has posted a warning regarding the MD5 usage in the last version of <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/">ClrMamePro</a>. But you didn't need that warning anyway, right? ;)|||1||
1025128550|pi|Call it hobby, or call it addiction...|Another massive update at <a href="http://www.system16.com/">System16 - The Arcade Museum</a> courtesy of Sixtoe. RLS syndrome hasn't affected him (too much) and again he serves us a great deal of arcade information and goodies. There is simply too much to mention - like usual. The changes range from the oldest era of discrete components to the newest X-Box and Triforce hardware. My advice is to just dive in :) Thanks Sixtoe for your continued efforts! (And you, the reader, could try to overhelm him as well with even more positive support e-mails!)|||1||
1025213679|pi|Errare humanum est but this is getting ridiculous|The story today is about <a href="http://xbox.mame.net/">MAME-X</a>. Microsoft has finally went down over it and asked for the binaries to be removed. As usual M$ tries to control everything, this really looks like fascism in the information technologies... The story has been <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/06/27/1743229.shtml?tid=167">slashdotted</a> as well.<br><br>The good news is that only the binaries with the official SDK have been sanctioned, so it means that the sources will still be maintained and distributed by Opcode (btw there is a new beta 4), and if in the future an unofficial X-Box SDK appears, binaries might be back. Anyway it's sad cause one of these days, Microsoft will simply go too much far... Thanks to Chris for the /. link.|||1||
1025213697|pi|One is enough|For third day in a row, more <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm">CottAGE WIP</a>. I can't help to just post it since I'm a faithful fan of CottAGE :) Short but juicy: 1943 Kai has been added by Erik. Another good shooter for casual play while browsing at work, home, library... :)|||1||
1025213759|pi|The Nth Diff|M.A.S.H. has released another diff-update, for <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/">MameInfo.dat 4.09</a>. This time besides the usual latest-bugs-and-newest-info stuff, there is a fix removing the 'region' word from the listinfo changes and the inclusion of information from the arcade emulators (what else) Calice and CottAGE.|||1||
1025213779|pi|You know what my advice is...|Roman has issued a little update of his beast - errr I mean his star app :) <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/">ClrMamePro 2.66a</a>. There is some retouched MD5 stuff you should be aware of: "revised the md5 stuff" were his words. Be warned. Now continue your journey.|||1||
1025213841|pi|Nos complace anunciar...|As a surprise, here is a new version of our favorite EXE compressor, <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX 1.22</a>. Markus and Laszlo have fixed a small problem in the atari/tos format, and the source has been modified slightly to support a few more compilers straight away. The GUI are still in development, and there's a mention that the next stable release will be 2.00, maybe it means a rewrite? Btw anyone really tried that new memory improved compression mode?|||1||
1025283089|pi|More sad truth|This is understandable so don't blame anyone. <a href="http://xbox.mame.net/">MAME-X</a> is not longer hosted at <a href="http://www.mame.net/">mame.net</a>. When I know where it's moved I'll place a link here. While I was aware yesterday about the rights of Microsoft to ask for the binaries to be taken down, it also shows how badly they want to control anything you might do with their products. Soon they will tell you which sites you can visit with Interbleed Exploder. I use Nutscrape anyway :-p|||1||
1025283139|pi|Too much fun in one package|Some <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> for the weekend. The last four days have been logged by Gridle the webslave (hey the nick was HIS idea!) and some pictures of 4 Fun in 1 which is a game containing some classics. Other worthy things happening are: The graphics of Equites are fixed, Neo Geo raster effects were made more accurate thanks to a recent info from Raz, and the rest should be read by yourself... :)|||1||
1025283165|pi|My dream is to have a cast... errr no I already had, kthx|There is info about a new project called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/john.cabrer/index.html">MAMECAST</a> made by John Cabrer.

1025470778|pi|Handle with care|For the ones who don't fear memory address, layer maps, opcodes and all that evil stuff, you might want to check <a href="http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/">Charles MacDonald's Home Page</a> where he has posted some good findings about Sega's System 16/18 hardware. The reading is a bit dense but if you are interested in the technical stuff, well there it is...|||1||
1025470799|pi|Round colored toys|More <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> for our eyes. Two days with many fixes in general, and specifically in Car Polo and Equites. Haze added support for Bubble 2000, and well, go'n'read!|||1||
1025470828|pi|After so long...|<a href="http://www.daphne-emu.com/">DAPHNE 0.99.5</a> has been finally released. No "pre", no "maybe", the f.e.m.a.l.e. emulator (put some sense to that acronym) comes in Windows and Linux flavors, and of course the source. The changelog, which is quite long (has to be with four pre-releases) can also be found in the download page. Have fun!|||1||
1025471320|pi|Cough, cough|There's more <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm">CottAGE WIP</a>. Erik finished the 1943 driver, and added Gun.Smoke as well. I know this WIP doesn't include as much technical info as others, but well, give them time ;)|||1||
1025471340|pi|A rare specimen...|Mike Haggar has released <a href="http://haggar.emuunlim.com/">Nebula/Kawaks Transparencies Pack 20020630</a>. It includes tables for The Last Blade 2, in light and heavy modes. Mike also whines about the lack of tables coming, and me too since I used to find quite some and now it's hard to see them... So a) make them and b) submit them to him!|||1||
1025471361|pi|Not exactly a goodbye...|As of tomorrow, <a href="http://www.atani-software.net/">Atani</a> will no longer work in any emulation related stuff. One of the developers who was around here for the longest is saying bye, and he talks a lot on his last post at his site, which I strongly recommend to read. He mentions he will be still around, will revamp his site, but the future might not include programming. Well whatever you do Atani, thanks for your work for the community, and good luck with whatever comes. And hope to see you around here for a long long time!|||1||
1025553002|pi|Let's tap ourselves on the shoulders...|Today I've been exactly 181 days, exactly six months, half a year without smoking! It might look stupid to some of you, but for me it's a great achievement, equivalent to a 100% perfect System 16 emulator :-p I saved 368 euros in all this time, enough to make a cabinet... Well let's say I've not spent them, since I haven't seen any of those little coins :/ But I'm proud of myself, for once in a while :) As proud as someone else, I know you will be reading this so congrats for your six months as well Erik :)<br><br>To celebrate it I've been job hunting, one of the sports I hate the most. I'm at the top of the list for another shitty job but well, what can I do. I have to buy a new mouse. Really!|||1||
1025553019|pi|Win something, for a change|<a href="http://www.rackspace.co.uk/promo/starwars.php?supbid=theregsw5">Rackspace</a> is offering a quite good prize. An original Star-Wars: The Arcade Game sit-down machine. The price is participating in a survey, something I don't like at all. But as <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/">Metallik</a> says, they have chosen a good reward! Thanks to him for the tip.|||1||
1025553038|pi|Where are the pictures?|Colorless, one-day <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a>. Acho A. Tang fixed the missing or bad music in a handful NeoGeo games. The NeoGeo driver keeps getting improvements over all these years, which is something quite good, don't you think? Stephh fixed more inputs and DSW (go go Stephh!) as usual, while Haze is around like usual. But. Where's my release? (Yes I know I shouldn't whine but I'm human, what can I do...)<br>|||1||
1025553076|pi|It sounds familiar to me|Dith is back posting two new samplesets: Buck Rogers and Gridlee. The Buck Roger ones have been optimized and filtered out the noise, and the Gridlee ones suffer from a cut & paste description so I don't know what's different compared to the official ones :) Get them at <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/dith/">Dith's Enhanced MAME Samples</a>.|||1||
1025645331|pi|Two more around|Moose has released two freeware utilities for Windows systems, one called <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamenewreleasetalk&Number=16755&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post16755">ROM Clone Zip Manager</a> and the other <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamenewreleasetalk&Number=16756&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post16756">ROM ZIP Differences Manager</a>.

1025645390|pi|People pays attention ;)|Erik Duijs fixed some bugs in a CPU core and added support for single opcode decryption. This effectively adds support for one more classic: Roc'n Rope. All this can be read and seen at the <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm">CottAGE WIP</a> page :)|||1||
1025645416|pi|A little mixed bag|I'd like to mention some things while I'm here:<ul><li><a href="http://www.fraggersxtreme.com/samples/">Twisty's MAME Samples</a> now feature yesterday's release of <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/dith/">Dith's Enhanced Samples</a>.</li><li>I usually don't post about frontends with a few exceptions.

1025735060|pi|Ping? Pong!|Two days of <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> have been logged by Gridle, the pictures with the wrong colours are from Speed Spin, and they are courtesy of Haze which made the driver playable. More things to read if you're interested...|||1||
1025735076|pi|Conversation, talking, speech...|Metafox has released <a href="http://www.emucamp.com/laser/">Laser blah</a>. It's a new flavor of this little arcade emu, which mostly means "a quick build". He has added all the 8080 games in MAME. He also makes a subtle call for more people to join the team ;)|||1||
1025735116|pi|Give me a banana|The <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/">CottAGE</a> chart of development has been updated, look those dots how are getting placed in better positions :) The WIP has been updated as well, with good news for monkey fans... Visit it!|||1||

The Carbon build includes the changes from the interim releases happened lately, but the Classic build is still from 0.57 and "as such should work well". Strange, but well :)|||1||
1025735168|pi|Anyone tells me please why that name!|According with the tradition, MHz instantly supports the latest xored games with the release of the new <a href="http://kawaks.retrogames.com/">Kawaks 1.44a</a>. There are also new drivers for Sengoku 3, V-Liner and Zuppapa (all NeoGeo games) as well, and a SF2 hack too, plus a new blending effect, some NeoGeo fixes, QAD japanese is fixed, and a few fixes and improvements here and there for this already very solid emulator. Can't wait to play it!|||1||
1025735188|pi|Fresh XOR's for you|Tonight and after two months, we have more XOR tables from Razoola at <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/">CPS2Shock</a>. The tables are for two clones of Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter and Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow over Mistara, and for a new game: Vampire Hunter 2. With this I think all the Darkstalkers games have been decripted, despite of the clones. Good news indeed! :)<br><br>Read the statements about Nebula in the CPS2Shock page, there's no need for a new release of an emulator with text drivers :) And Raz says that there's no CPS2MAME this time, so let's wait for the next MAME to happen very soon!|||1||

Don't expect early dat releases, he will do them when he can. So be patient, k? :)|||1||

1025816179|pi|No, it's not MAME!|More development in the arcade world, now it's turn for <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm">CottAGE WIP</a>, which keeps being updated with good news. Erik has added a Konami hardware and support for Hyper Sports and Road Fighter. He has defeated a little bug (which is no more) and implemented row scroll methods. So the question is: Will we wait two months or so long for the next CottAGE release?|||1||
1025816208|pi|A quick one|Today's <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/">MAME WIP</a> is probably included in the last release, at least the Toobin fix is... The pictures are from Triple Fun, which has been added with some little graphic glitches due to a corrupt rom. |||1||
1025816283|pi|Speaks for itself...|Finally, after so much wait, the long awaited and much expected <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME 0.61 Jack</a>. The <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html">changelog</a> is shorter than I expected, but there are some big core changes including what IMHO is the star of this release: generic and awesome artwork support! In short words:<br><ul><li>Generic artwork support, rewritten display functions.</li><li>Six drivers with better graphics, three with better sound, and six more with miscellaneous changes including various Neo Geo fixes, and input and graphics fix for... Outrun!!!</li><li>Light gun support.</li><li>More than 30! MAMETesters bugs fixed.</li><li>Fifty (or more not in the list) new games supported, like Battle Bakraider.</li><li>Twenty or more new clones.</li></ul><br>So in short, big thanks to Nicola and all the great MAMEDevs for this release, for the continued efforts and... Well you know it, you people totally rock! Now it's time to play... Remember, it's all about the games!<br><br><i>Source and binaries are available right now, except the DOS version...

It features the most bizarre games in MAME, so if you're tired of standard, clone games, you might try some of the strange beauties Greg has found for us.

As well they added a handful of clones, fixed some drivers and one CPU core, and optimized here and there enough to get a significant boost in certain drivers.

Of course there are many other fixes here and there, you should read by yourself.|||1||

1028755385|pi|The new game|And of course Mr. K pleases us with <a href="http://kawaks.retrogames.com/">Kawaks 1.45</a>, which has a quite long changelog with stuff for all tastes. For example, now blitters work in 32bpp modes, correct NeoGeo random number generation, and there is a MTF switch :) There are lots of fixes and suprise, besides the latest XOR's, there is support for that last NeoGeo homebrew game called Neo No Panepon.

Besides the new games, there is a handful of fixes for some games, plus he added 6 slot MVS support. Great! Which was the biggest NeoGeo machine, 16 slots? :)<br><br>And even if you don't use Nebula (why not? It rocks!) you should pass by its <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">bilingual homepage</a> which has a cool new look!|||1||

This time the XOR'ed games are clones of already available games: X-Men COTA & SFZ2A for Asia and Megaman 2 for USA. Raz has also released CPS2MAME 0.611, supporting all of the above. He has also made a temporary ClrMamePro dat for auditing your CPS2 ROMS. I've mailed him the RomCenter version and hopefully he will post it there as well (hope he checks his email). And happy bday Raz :)|||1||

Since it has a few delicate things, distributing a binary would violate MAME license, so he decided to only release the source, so this is for pro's :) Note that there is a version of PatchMAME32 for GUI lovers...|||1||
1028843426|pi|More documentation|WTC has updated <a href="http://emustatus.rainemu.com/">Emulation Status</a> with some corrections and things coming from quite a lot of sources.

Yeah you've heard well: Dragon's Lair, Dragon's Lair II and Space Ace endings, in full motion video. All the three endings is something like 80mb or so, but IMHO great to bring back good memories. Nice way to start the summer holidays (i.e. no more updates in a week).|||1||

This time the stars are: Haze's Super Kaneko Nova driver, a prototype called Speed Ball added by Aaron and Battle Bakraid's sound fix by Guru and RB. Great! Details and more on the page.|||1||

As he warns, you will have to get again some drivers to work with this new version. |||1||
1031693469|pi|A new fine game|After so much Neohype, 3Dflood and such things, old 2D platform games come back with <a href="http://www.videojuegosamazing.com/2002/snowb3/snowbrothers3.htm" target=_blank>Snow Brothers 3</a>. This same company will announce Toki II as well. It seems these games might be unlicensed, tho. Thanks to Unknown Soldier for the info.|||1||

1031761554|pi|Life goes on|Well, after the serious thoughts, time for the usual gaming stuff. But before, a bit of advertisement :) There is a new release at Cerulean Studios: the free IM <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/" target=_blank>Trillian 0.74</a>. It's the IM of my choice, fully free, simultaneous support for AOL IM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo IM and basic IRC... Skinnable and packed with good features. A good option for you IM junkies.|||1||
1031761598|pi|Moved to a good place|CANAME, the Capcom And Neogeo MAME variation with tons of new things has moved with his brother JMAME to <a href="http://mamespi.sourceforge.jp/" target=_blank>MAME Spirits</a>. Update your bookmarks.|||1||
1031761678|pi|Never enough with Driving|There is an update at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's Home Page</a>, by your (or at least my) favorite MAME dev. After quite long, he again shows his progress, this time about Atari Polygon games, with a good long WIP page full of screenies and information. Not advisable to miss it!|||1||
1031761718|pi|Still one of the best|Here it is, as announced: <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.36</a>. New games: Strikers 1945 and Tengai/Sengoku Blade (for all of you who can't wait for MAME), and three new clones for Gunbird, ESP Ra.De. and Sengoku Ace. Features: new documentation, wav logging, digital sound in Toki and Silkworm, fixed CPS1 sprite priorities, faster Psikyo games, and Battle Bakraid has good sound (only with the latest Guru's dump!). These just to <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/rainedoc/node78.html" target=_blank>name a few</a>! Get everything you need for your RAINEing experience!|||1||
1031761761|pi|Here comes the long awaited title|Razoola also puts his grain of sand today, rather a big grain actually at <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/" target=_blank>CPS2Shock</a>: XOR release day! The games are Cyberbots (USA) and the big surprise: Giga Wing! The USA and Japan versions have been XOR'ed. He has also recompiled and released CPS2mame v2.612 to support these releases, and also includes a fix for raster effects in X-Men Vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter.|||1||
1031761783|pi|Nebula keeps getting bigger|ElSemi keeps with the tradition and releases <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula 2.19c</a> on XOR day. The only novelties are the new XOR's support, and fixing of a nasty bug which caused CPS-1 Q-Sound games to crash. As you might now, he is busy with other things...|||1||
1031770018|pi|A sign?|It's <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a>, again. Like Gridle says, excellent and quick progress. Everyone (apparenlty) has been busy with the Super Kaneko Nova system. Check all the shots of so many Gal/Jan games :)|||1||
1031780287|pi|I sense a release...|The first MAME variation to have been updated for latest XOR's is <a href="http://mamespi.sourceforge.jp/" target=_blank>CANAME 0.61.7</a>. Since the what's new hasn't been translated from japanese, I guess it has the new XOR's and then some UI changes :)|||1||
1031840088|pi|Good news for Greece|Such a ridiculous law couldn't stand up for too long, thankfully... As explained in this <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-957519.html?tag=fd_top" target=_blank>News.com article</a>, that greek law banning videogames, effectively banned videogames (not like others were saying), and hence was declared inconstitutional by a judge. Congrats for my mediterranean neighbours! Thanks to Twisty for the info.|||1||
1031866615|pi|Shin day|Users ask for, Roman grants. <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro 2.73</a> is the latest effort to have everything working well before next MAME. This time it addresses Windows 95 compatibility. I got lost in all that release mania comment, but well... Anyway I like the release mania, as long as it sticks to one version per day ;)|||1||
1031866638|pi|Fixes fixes fixes|ElSemi works fast and releases a fixed <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula 2.19d</a>. Moo has sound again, and an old resetting bug with Eco Fighters which also showed in Giga Wing got fixed too.|||1||
1031866672|pi|Zeroed for you|Raz has recompiled <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/" target=_blank>CPS2MAME 2.613</a>, which fixes that annoying thing with the zeroes in Giga Wing. I guess he will update *again* his dats...|||1||
1031866703|pi|Datman Returns|Official statement from <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a> at his site. Yes I can confirm the team stuff is going well, hopefully it will start to work soon with some good and up-to-date dats. In the meanwhile, he has released dats for <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>CPS-2 and MAME 0.61</a> (including changes). Just in time for next MAME, maybe :)|||1||
1031928657|pi|Today is your day|Well, today is Friday the 13th. Are you ready for the fun tonight?|||1||
1031928682|pi|Bueno...|Well actually the last CANAME didn't have the XOR'ed games, excuse my lack of japanese skill :) But <a href="http://mamespi.sourceforge.jp/" target=_blank>CANAME 0.61.8</a> has them! Also now the english page is there, maybe I missed it past time. Uh my head...|||1||
1031928700|pi|News-X|Somehow I missed an update past wednesday, about <a href="http://mame-x.xb-power.com/" target=_blank>MAME-X</a>, the X-Box port. Mainly it talks about changed and fixed things which will be in next release. Excuse me Xboxers, but for me is hard to track all this arcade-on-console stuff since I'm not motivated ;)|||1||
1031928721|pi|(wash)Machine code|Another update I missed is the release of <a href="http://mac.emuhq.com/cpsmame/" target=_blank>CPSMAME 9.11.02</a>, the CPS-only MAME for the Mac users. Of course it includes the latest XOR'ed games and all that stuff. But, Giga Wing doesn't work with the PPC ASM 68K CPU cores, so there is another version available with the other really slow C cores...|||1||
1031928790|pi|Mr. Giles watches you|And one more change at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron Giles' page</a>. Not as "big" as the Atari Polygon WIP (everyone seemed so mayhem about Steel Tallons). It includes his to-do list (so you know what he is going to attack in the future), his MAME Log (so you know what he has attacked in the past), and the Slapstic FAQ, updated with info on a new chip. So there is a bit for everyone, and don't forget to check his Fun Facts!|||1||
1031966259|pi|Blimey, free time!|Yes, the man with more fingers than usual has updated <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a>. Sixtoe has made a really big update, I wouldn't know where to start. I'd mention tho his new Appendix, useful for people who doesn't master all the technical terms around all this hardware mess :) Thanks man for such a great effort on this truly great site!|||1||
1032023588|pi|Giga Cheat|One weekend, one update? Haggar has uploaded & linked <a href="http://haggar.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>FBA & Nebula/Kawaks Cheat Archive & MAME Cheat File 0.2.93</a>, with all the new Giga Wing cheats (and Cyberbots USA), more cheats for MvsC and a bunch of fixed cheats. I guess this is quite a big update, so you know the rule...|||1||
1032023645|pi|Double WIP with cheese and bacon|Time for another <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a> report. Lots of stuff going on with the Super Kaneko Nova and Psikyo SH2 systems, it seems everyone is putting their hands on them to polish. Actually the only other change not related to these that I can see right now is a proper Z80 reset after service mode (classic bug), submitted by Mr. Rodewald. Good boy Barry!|||1||
1032042173|pi|Woes and growls|As my program AhorroTabaco/SmokeSavings says, I've been without smoking 2^8 days (100 in hex). In that time I've saved 523 euros (which I've not seen anywhere anyway). If I ever get to install again everything needed to remove an offending <a href="http://www.silentcircle.com/" target=_blank>URL</a> from the program and fix the only bug it has, I will release it. However making a good program like this (well it's a simple one), saving big bucks, or even being such a long time without a single smoke doesn't make me happy. Bad day today, maybe PMS? Today I want to kill someone. Maybe... You!|||1||
1032094539|pi|ISO 9001?|After a long time, Gridle has updated once again <a href="http://www.mame.net/downart.html" target=_blank>MAME's Artwork page</a>. Note that this page contains only the artwork Gridle thinks is good enough. So only around 30 additions, but seem to share a good quality level.|||1||
1032122443|pi|BeRAINE|BeOS users can now enjoy the last RAINE with the binary available at <a href="http://www.beemulated.net/" target=_blank>BeEmulated.net</a>. RAINE 0.36 has good changes indeed!|||1||
1032130469|pi|Visrtually striking|I don't know if people has seen some more Model 2 WIP, apparently there are two new pics of the game Virtua Striker. <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/tmp/vstriker1.jpg" target=_blank>Picture 1</a> and <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/tmp/vstriker2.jpg" target=_blank>picture 2</a> show progress in the 3D drawing but still far from perfect. Thanks to Karadoc for the hint.|||1||
1032185824|pi|Only for your eyes|Charles McDonald has made available a preliminary document about <a href="http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/" target=_blank>Sega System 18 Hardware</a>. Beware, it's hardcore read. He mentions a few bits more in his news, and says he will complete the information soon.|||1||
1032186016|pi|The family grows|I knew I was missing something in the news lately... <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm" target=_blank>CottAGE WIP</a>! Two good additions: A new member in the team, called LFE, and preliminary support for Tropical Angel.|||1||

Well actually yes, but still they keep working hard and here we have <a href="http://x.mame.net/" target=_blank>X-MAME 0.61.1-pre4</a>. This Preview Release 4 will become the final 0.61.1 if nothing goes wrong. The list of changes is quite long. Among everything, sound logging :)|||1||
1032273569|pi|Move'em up!|More <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm" target=_blank>CottAGE WIP</a> from the newest member of the growing development team. This time LFE added support for Mr. Jong/Crazy Blocks. Still some wrong colors but nothing which can't be fixed with a bit of time.|||1||
1032285787|pi|For one of the Avengers|Hey man, I just wanted to comment you that you're missing something: <a href="http://garfield.ucomics.com/garfield/gaview.cfm?uc_full_date=19840331&uc_comic=ga&uc_daction=X" target=_blank>One single Garfield strip</a>. Thanks for the other 9,000 ;)<br>|||1||

It has a configfile patch reapplied, and the changelog correctly reflects the real name of the -audiodevice parameter (was -waveout, ick). Preview Release 4's users are lucky enough to need to apply only a tiny little smallish patch.|||1||
1032356363|pi|Gotta love the version numbering!|Tux is spoiling us with the quick and bugfixed versions lately for each major release. So here we have <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.36.1</a> which is packed with lots of fixes. The changelog is stated in the frontpage, lots of things in the GunBird driver, fixed music and adpcm sound, demos, well, you know the deal :)|||1||
1032375820|pi|Viva yesyes|Logiqx has released <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>datfiles for VivaNonno 22.0.3</a>. There are some differences from already existing ones, so I'd suggest you that if System 22 is your choice, then get these dats for ClrMAMEPro and RomCenter.|||1||
1032443460|pi|Infinite 0.61.x ahead?|Another spirit release: <a href="http://mamespi.sourceforge.jp/" target=_blank>CANAME 0.61.9</a>. Small fixes, but I like the idea of a message saying something when there are no dips. Is that enought to make you download it? :) Who knows...|||1||
1032443491|pi|He does sound like a broken record :)|And again another candidate for 0.61.1: <a href="http://x.mame.net/" target=_blank>X-MAME 0.61.1-pr6</a>. The sixth in the saga fixes the MAME_NET support. Again only a tiny small little minimal patch.|||1||
1032472613|pi|Missed myself?!?!?|Oh well... I was expecting that I got to my first thousand news posts and I missed it. Blame myself! Actually this is my 1,030th post, could you believe it?

Taking into account the MAME Icons dat (done by the team), it's being done quite some work on the dat-side there. Getting better every day!|||1||
1032545210|pi|Alan, where are you?|Uh, honestly, I hate this kind of teasers. Now I will be unable to sleep until I discover which is the game mentioned in the <a href="http://mimic.arcadeheaven.com/" target=_blank>Mimic WIP</a>. What's that formula? Some secret code I don't recognize (I haven't gone to school in my current reincarnation) which might shed a little light over the secret? Any information will be appreciated, thanks.|||1||
1032707126|pi|Too much work|Gridle has updated once again the <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a> and still no sign from 0.62! But well, the WIP deals with some interesting stuff in these last seven days. There is good sound, music, linescroll and sprite placing in the SKNS driver, total slapstic support in Rampart, the new games Ace and N.Y. Captor, updated Starship 1 driver, and finally a better Namco System 2 driver with real protection emulation which makes Lucky & Wild and Suzuka 8 Hours 2 playable. Thanks to all the devs for their contributions, and go read the remaining bits, they're also worthy!|||1||
1032707156|pi|Atomiswhat? Chocolate who? Gotta love the names :)|Sixtoe has been kind enough to tell me by email about his last update at <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a>! It's an historical day, two big updates in such a short time! Well about the update itself, as usual there is a lot of everything, but I guess one of the interesting bits is the inclusion of information about Chihiro (X-Box hardware), mention of the future Naomi 3 hardware (interesting bit), and the change from System X to... Atomiswave! What's that? Oh well I can't tell all which has changed, would be too long. Go there and read yourself :-p|||1||

Almost :)|||1||

It's a Sega Saturn and ST-V hardware emulator, that means Titan-Video arcade games for you! Read the post carefully, and as the author says, also read the documentation! For now it's a DOS binary, doesn't run at full speed and there are emulation parts still missing. We're waiting patiently then :) Thanks to The Informer for the news!|||1||
1033592725|pi|Big, bigger, biggest|Big <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm" target=_blank>CottAGE WIP</a> this time. Gollum is the lone star today too, with quite some more games and screenies than we're used too. Check them out for your future browser enjoyment.|||1||

It detects duplicates by CRC among zipfiles, allows recursion and it's very fast.

No it's not Stephh ;) Anyway that's old stuff, you gotta see the screenies on the <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip0210.html" target=_blank>archived WIP of the rest of the month</a>.

1033849728|pi|And old man told me...|There's an update at <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games</a>. Strange, uh? Well, the usual batch of information about more games, removed some missing items from the 0.61 update, and a new page for games without CPU which has a terribly bad explanation :)|||1||

Along iwth the newest WIP and latest bugs, he has removed the artwork info, and added LEVELS information for the first fourth of games (aproximately). I'm curious to see that LEVELS thing, what it could be?|||1||
1033907805|pi|Another point of view|And now, <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm" target=_blank>CottAGE WIP</a> in 3D! Erik Duijs has been playing with Java3D, and the result as you can see in the snap, is some 3D perspective view while playing games, and also full screen playing. Nice. <i>But I think StretchMAME did this too?</i>|||1||
1033937671|pi|This Java3D thing|What you saw on the last CottAGE WIP, has been added to <a href="http://www.home.zonnet.nl/duijs24/jemu/" target=_blank>JEmu</a> too, of course by Erik Duijs again :) He also change the Z80 core from the recent CottAGE changes, which resulted in a performance improvement. Again, Erik's main project is CottAGE, and JEmu was changed as a kind of teaser before the new release of CottAGE sees the light. <i>To Erik: look at <a href="http://stretchmame.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>StretchMAME</a>. Sorry man :)</i>|||1||

1034171169|pi|La Grange|As Dan said, the expected update at <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/" target=_blank>The Arcade Flyers Archive</a> has come. There are around 30 new flyers, lots of japanese, and even one spanish :) Check it, and all the others if you want, but well... Haw!|||1||
1034180898|pi|Yes, chicks really dig Pi!|After its <i>not very</i> triumphal appareance in the Loony Bin, I've polished the <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/srmp4.html" target=_blank>SRMP4 sprite rip</a>, removing some remaining backgrounds, fixing a problem with certain non-transparent colours, and also left the originals available. It was fun :)|||1||
1034190484|pi|The dat flood continues|And even more datafiles from <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a>, this time Laser and Mimic were updated.

1034196233|pi|The next step|Mr. Giles is on it again, if you check <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's MAME WIP</a>, you will see a couple of shots from the self-test of Williams V-Unit hardware.

1034431621|pi|Latest news|Update at <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>Guru's ROM Dumping News</a>. He has dumped another Super System 22 game, called Cyber Cycles, and also updated his Sega Model 2 page with more snaps and comments.|||1||

1034517576|pi|I can't find my headline|Mike Beaver has released <a href="http://mimic.arcadeheaven.com/" target=_blank>Mimic 2.09</a>, which needs updated HWC's. Not all of them have been updated yet, so be patient. About what's new, well that totally new Z80 core, fixes in the 68000 core, analog controls and a few more things. The future doesn't seem to bring much on the arcade side, but I'm still hopeful :)|||1||
1034543908|pi|Pieces of history|Mr. Datman a.k.a. <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a> has updated once again the Older Emus archive, removing U64Emu (which is new again and already in the recent list), and adding the four old emulators made by Nicola Salmoria, before he merged them into what is now MAME.|||1||
1034629416|pi|Cruisin' Driver|Another update at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's Home Page</a>.

1034688542|pi|Aaron's Cruisin' Bandwidth|Again <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's Home Page</a> surpassed its transfer limit, rendering the WIP page without images until further notice. I guess that Cruisin' USA WIP shots were just too much. I think the girl with the flag was the culprit! :)|||1||
1034688561|pi|Spirit Drivers(tm)|After Field Combat, <a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>Haze's MAME Page</a> features another WIP driver for a game called Hanaroku. It seems to be another of those Mahjong match cards game. |||1||

It features some fixes, a lot of SF2 hacks, and hiscore saving for CPS-2 games! You can use (after some conversion) MAME's hiscore.dat for this. At last my only missing feature :)|||1||
1034776008|pi|Extremely thin fighter|Apparently the nineth chapter of the XiaoXiao series (the stick figure martial arts fighter and all-around tough guy) has been released. The <a href="http://www.xiaoxiaomovie.com/" target=_blank>Official XiaoXiao Homepage</a> is really being hammered for this movie, even when it doesn't even have the eighth yet! It seems the flash movie is available in an <a href="http://www.hackernetwork.com/flash/stickdeath9.shtml" target=_blank>alternate place</a>, and it's labeled as a demo. It's a Final Fight style game, just with stick figures. Thanks to Lion2 for the hint.|||1||

Now Crusin' USA looks better and Cruisin' World boots and shows some good progress, tho still needs a lot of work. Both games seem to be real CPU eaters, so don't put your hopes too high!|||1||
1034862680|pi|A long way ahead|Not only that I'm personally interested in <a href="http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/" target=_blank>ScummVM</a>, but also I think that their current legal issues have a parallelism with emulators. Their last status update contains a legal part which shows their progress with LucasArts in making ScummVM completely legal and endorsed by LucasArts. This would be a great step in a territory close to arcade emulation, and maybe other game manufacturers will see the light. Let's hope so, cause this is only one step, which has to be taken before others can be done...|||1||
1034887212|pi|One week after|Time for more <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a>. The last week of development has been archived and presented for your enjoyment. Haze has sent drivers for Field Combat (playable but not complete), Cross Shooter (not playable) and Hanaroku (complete with sound). R. Belmont added sound to quite some games, and Stroff added Legion. Aaron Giles also did some things here and there, besides his preliminary works in Cruisin' Anywhere.

This is the Sega Model 2B emulator he has been working on, and the source of those snaps we saw some time ago in Emulatronia. Read the documentation for the list of all known problems, like no textures or sound, and the specs it needs (1Ghz anyone?). To finish, it supports all good dumps of Model 2B games. Duckie has posted at <a href="http://nonmame.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>NonMAME</a> a list of them, and remember the Model 2 page at <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>Guru's ROM Dumping News</a>.|||1||

There's also a fix in the 68k cores by Mike Coates (hinted by Razoola), Stephh fixed dips and inputs here and there, and some otehr things, as usual worth reading.|||1||

There aren't any CPU estimations, but I think my 333 will have a trouble with them, and my 56k too ;) On another note, that One Shot One Kill driver by Haze and Tourniquet has been submitted with still some graphics glitches and no sound.

There are still a few remaining problems with analog controls and OpenGL, but well this is a start. Look at the last <a href="http://x.mame.net/changes-unix.html" target=_blank>changelog</a>, and see among other things support for Linux on PS2 (!), .wav logging, and better FreeBSD support.

Being the Lord And Supreme Ruler Of All Known And Unknown Universes, Dimensions and Similars, he was forced to make a form-based email page with some common sense rules to contact him. I say all this in hopes he didn't sent to the trashcan my own last email :)|||1||

1038175111|pi|Yet another one|Another little update at <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/catlist/" target=_blank>CatList</a>, fixing the categories of some more adult games. I think he might not have looked at my list yet, maybe...|||1||
1038175138|pi|Excellent|Maybe you haven't looked at it this weekend, but Haze's <a href="http://haze.mame.net/xtra/stuff.html" target=_blank>Sega System 32 WIP</a> driver is evolving and there is that page which shows it. Also besides the "old" Golden Axe 2 and the already seen Holosseum, you can see much more games with different levels of success.|||1||
1038233216|pi|Bang bang! You're dead|There are some shots over at <a href="http://www.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Emulatronia</a> from a newly emulated game called Bang! by Gaelco. It has been added by Manuel Abadia of <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/single/combatschool.shtml" target=_blank>Escuela de Combate</a> fame.|||1||
1038263418|pi|Hornet, ahhhhh old times...|There is a very preliminar attempt at emulating the <a href="http://www.smallnews.net/azuco/" target=_blank>Konami Hornet System</a>. It's a PowerPC powered and quite recent arcade system. Azuco has ported a graphics viewer as a first step, and well it shows something... That seems the Gradius 4: Fukkatsu logo. Don't forget to check the <a href="http://www.system16.com/konami/hrdw_hornet.html" target=_blank>System16</a> page about this hardware (link available in Azuco's page too). Thanks to <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Prophet</a> for not killing me for stealing his news :)|||1||
1038263447|pi|\n?|Roman has released <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro 2.83.1</a>, which is a bugfix release solving three little problems. And one big problem :) Let's update anyway.|||1||
1038326059|pi|Move quickly|Katharsis from <a href="http://www.geoshock.com/" target=_blank>GeoShock</a> has released once again his fast build FastMAME 0.62. No SIMD release now. This windows binary has <i>only one</i> difference: being built with a highly optimized compiler, resulting in a 10% to 30% more performance. Go to GeoShock to get the file. Thanks to Manolo for the hint.|||1||
1038326243|pi|Finally I can|Warlock has wrote me to tell me he fixed <a href="http://emustatus.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>Emulation Status</a>, so now the Java hover buttons are no more (they weren't earlier, anyway) and now you can visit without problems the DEEP section among others :) Thanx man.|||1||
1038352092|pi|B.I.G. Remake|Star Control 2 is a lovely game which gave me lots of fun playing against a friend years ago. Now this remake is simply too cool, today it was released <a href="http://sc2.sourceforge.net/" target=_blank>Ur-Quan Masters 0.1 alpha</a>, the first version of this top-quality remake. However, there is a drawback - for an alpha release, it's 140 megs! I think I'll stick playing GLQuake... A beauty I never tried before! Whoooo ReaperBot!|||1||
1038423902|pi|Test test test|By popular demand, <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro 2.84</a> has been released with full CHD scanning support, which might be longer but will please us OC checkers :) Fortunately the endless testing can be cancelled in case we realize we can't check the CHD for the fifth time right now.|||1||
1038423933|pi|Same orchestra, different director|There's a new alternate sampleset hosted at <a href="http://www.fraggersxtreme.com/samples/" target=_blank>Twisty's MAME Samples Collection</a>. It's an enhanced and alternate version of the Asteroids samples, done by Gyrovision, which sounds different than the common one (the sampleset, not Gyro!) So if this was your version of Asteroids, you could take a look. However it's for an old MAME: 0.36b16... Anyway, gotta try!|||1||
1038423952|pi|Here but not here|After a long long wait, here is <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>CottAGE 0.11</a>. However it's still not downloadable, but it's playable from the CottAGE home for betatesting purposes. Now it supports more than 130 games, fullscreen (page) and three new blitters: double size, TV Mode (?) and the famous scale2x. And from what I saw in the WIP and what Erik told me, it seems it has many internal changes too. Ah well I guess I'll have to sacrifice and do lots of betatesting :)|||1||
1038433785|pi|Sexy|If you kept visiting <a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>Haze's MAME Page</a> to check that superb System 32 WIP stuff, then you can stop reading now. If not, you should check the latest pics cause they look very well. Alien 3 and Rad Mobile lookin' gorgeous!|||1||
1038440699|pi|Rollin', rollin', rollin'|After missing one update past week, I am glad to report mode additions at <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/" target=_blank>The Arcade Flyers Archive</a>. That Watergate Caper thing really looks weird, I wonder if it was only a proto or was it ever real! Other additions include a special Pong flyer and Sea Battle from Zaccaria. Thanks to GregF for spotting this one.|||1||
1038519668|pi|Of course, he's the one|After all the hype and rumours, <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com" target=_blank>The Guru</a> placed something which makes things pretty clear. Find it. I have to say that I knew something wasn't smelling good...|||1||
1038519692|pi|Great stuff ahead|And he is none else than the humble <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/tourniquet/" target=_blank>Tourniquet</a>, which posted in his site some Psikyo SH-2 WIP, with certain fixes he has been doing for this driver. Text in Daraku Tenshi, a good rom self-test (which spotted a bad dump), per-row colour blending effects, and more you can see with snaps in his WIP section.|||1||
1038519713|pi|As Hawking's theories predict|The Supreme Lord of The Universe in an Emulated Nut-Shell, also known as <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron Giles</a>, wishes happy Thanksgiving and leaves a candy for us. It's a screenshot of the test screen of a <i>supposedly</i> unemulated game, <i>supposedly</i> by Atari since as RB noticed too, that font is well known (but also cause Aaron loves Atari), and <i>supposedly</i> Aaron is working in it to emulate it properly. What could it be? Time will tell.|||1||
1038519915|pi|I'm wondering, they're wondering|There are news on the <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>CottAGE Homepage</a>, with the results of the poll they were taking lately. More importantly, they discuss four of the options, mentioning there will be a big documentation improvement for those interested in contributing to the CottAGE project, and also interested in Java emulation in general with the "engine" Erik designed for CottAGE. They have another poll now, go and take it!|||1||
1038521142|pi|Old and new|As <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Prophet</a> reminds me, there has been a big update at <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/" target=_blank>Advance Projects</a>, where AdvanceMAME, AdvanceMESS, AdvanceMENU and AdvanceCAB got updated with new fixes and stuff. You can also check that the <a href="http://scale2x.sourceforge.net" target=_blank>Scale2x effect</a> got a new site at SourceForge. This new site contains more stuff than the old page at the Advance Homepage.|||1||
1038595010|pi|After the long wait...|And now some <a href="http://mimic.arcadeheaven.com/" target=_blank>Mimic WIP</a> with good news. He has got rid of that nasty bug on NT based systems. Now Mimic should work fine in Windows NT, 2000 and XP. But there is no release yet, not until he clears some more things. Read details above.|||1||
1038595030|pi|Non Plus Ultra|Here it is <a href="http://61.172.255.76/mamel/" target=_blank>MAME / MAME32 Plus! 0.62.2</a>, with several fixes allowing now the HD games to run, latest updates from Shiriru, and fixed Xexex to name a few. |||1||
1038595075|pi|Twisted mind|Even when the politic is to not give direct ROM links, Twisty has made and released a Galaga hack called <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mameworldgeneral&Number=73960&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post73960" target=_blank>Galaga Ghost</a>, which as you might figure, uses Pacman characters in a Galaga environment. Pretty cool, with custom samples for it also available at <a href="http://www.fraggersxtreme.com/samples/" target=_blank>Twisty's MAME Samples Collection</a>.|||1||
1038595418|pi|Saturday Night Flyer|Short time for another update at <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/" target=_blank>The Arcade Flyers Archive</a>, which consist of two rare Universal flyers from Fever. One is a better scan of a flyer already in the TAFA database, but the other is a very nice and rare Mr. Do's Wildride flyer. Check them out.|||1||
1038596401|pi|The Last Linkripper|Now it's time to steal the link from another one, the victim is Smitdogg and what he found is the page of <a href="http://www.paulbunyan.net/users/wayland/arcade/laststar.html#arcade" target=_blank>The Last Starfighter Movie and Video Game FAQ</a>, where it explains a lot of things from this strange game. The actual part interesting for us arcade lovers is the section about the <a href="http://www.paulbunyan.net/users/wayland/arcade/laststar.html#arcade" target=_blank>arcade game</a> where it gives quite some facts about this extremely rare game. It has been like ten years at least since I saw this movie last time, maybe it's time to see it again :)|||1||
1038692776|pi|Vitamine Supplements|You will find five updated datafiles at <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx.com</a>, all packaged by Rosewood (team member too). They are for FBA, Kawaks, RAINE, Nebula Jukebox and Neojukebox, and contain the new supplements against latest MAME. Of course with the exception of RAINE which matches last 0.36.2 release. Stay tuned, there are more dat updates coming!|||1||
1038692809|pi|And it has a pic of a cat ^_^|There is some WIP report at the <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com/mame32qa/" target=_blank>The MAME32 QA/Test & Art Dept.</a> Apparently the next MAME32 release will have tons of fixes, and I wonder what are those Aaron's sweeping changes.|||1||
1038692842|pi|No fake|A quite big update has appeared at <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games</a>. Besides the usual movement and removals, there are also some additions, new links and the fake section gets a juicy (but not sintactically correct) addition.|||1||
1038756980|pi|The White Pages|There is an update at the <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>CottAGE</a> download section, with MAME-style game lists for version 0.11. However the -listinfo is missing, as well as the 0.11 release. Patience...|||1||
1038756995|pi|Preliminary prerelease|Pierre Maziere has developed <a href="http://mamory.free.fr/" target=_blank>Mamory 0.0.1</a>. It's a library to manage roms, and it has been plugged into a little Linux command line rom manager which makes split-merged sets and can also make difference sets between two MAME versions. This first version is only available as binary, since the source has to be tidied up a bit more before released. There's not even a manual, since the page explains it all. Well remember that it's the first release - possible bugs and not many features. But the future is looking good. Thanks to Perforatu for the link.|||1||
1038757010|pi|I luv it|Grand Master Pete has done another state-of-the-art flovie called <a href="http://www.powerstrike.net/" target=_blank>MAME Love</a>. Have handy that kleenex box, this one will move you! Besides, he has changed a bit his Tehkan World Cup site, looking great and all.|||1||
1038779136|pi|Not so -listinfo|Finally here we have <a href="http://www.emuhype.com/" target=_blank>M1 0.7.1</a>. The new version of this arcade and pinball sound player comes with lots of bugfixes, a new advanced GUI for Linux and Windows, and (drums) 37 new games. Including Bonze Adventure! The download is a bit bigger this time, but well... The <a href="http://www.bannister.org/software/index.htm" target=_blank>Mac port by Richard Bannister</a> is already done too. Expect a datfile for this monster, eventually. The limited rom information output might prevent an early dat release. Belmont also mentions that a SDK will also be released soon.|||1||
1038779151|pi|Datlicatessen|<a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a> has issued more dat updates, for Final Burn (only supplements changed), Nebula and Nebula Model 2 Test (up-to-date with the new versions), and ZN System (new Strider 2 dumps). Feed your <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro</a> or <a href="http://www.romcenter.com/" target=_blank>RomCenter</a> (or any other rom manager) with this food and they will be most pleased.|||1||
1038865220|pi|The good and the bad news|M.A.S.H. released <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/" target=_blank>MameInfo.dat 4.23</a>, which includes as usual last bugs and newest WIP. It also contains 120 new level information thanks to <a href="http://www.mamend.emuita.it/" target=_blank>Vaz of MamEnd</a> (which is still down), and added more recommended games, todo and other notes. This is a diff update. Also note that if you scroll to the bottom, he has something to say about FMAME32 due to certain bugs in the MAME32 source.|||1||
1038865233|pi|Fix right here|The Beaver has released <a href="http://mimic.arcadeheaven.com/" target=_blank>Mimic 2.11</a>, with that Windows NT/2k/XP fix he mentioned shortly ago. He also mentions that some Sega fixes are included... Again not much in the arcade front, but well...|||1||
1038865258|pi|Two devil poppers|There is another update at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's Home Page</a>, with a couple more shots of that mistery game (which despite what some say, it's not know as of now). Aaron, the master of the donothing() and eatcpu() functions, wants to win again the award of slowest MAME driver.<br><br>But, has he noticed he is going to have <a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>another competitor</a>? Haze says he is going to take a break from the System 32 driver, which has seen more updates and progress lately. Let's hope he wants to come back at it soon.|||1||
1038865314|pi|Scripting gods|A little surprise from <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a>, it's the M1 0.7.1 datfile with MAME supplements included. Great! Now I only need some pinball stuff... Uhhhhh...<br>|||1||
1038865360|pi|New core absorbed|Tinker has released <a href="http://misfitmame.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>MisfitMAME 0.62</a>, which has a new total of 407 games (wow), which include the Street Fighter Hacks, tons of Xevious 2002, a lot of Twisty's hacks, and Super Derby. the normal builds are done, and soon the full builds will be added.|||1||
1038872717|pi|It was here, I swear it!|Roman has released <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro 2.85</a>, which apparently might be the last one this year, unless MAME 0.63 comes before and makes it needing some more changes. Take a look at the fixes and changes, some options were moved or removed, so don't be scared if you don't find something.|||1||
1038954573|pi|Crash on me, crash me on|A little bug has been found, and a little fix has been put into <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro 2.85.1</a>. No more crashes with full zip integrity checks. That was fast, Roman. Still I'm sure he will do even another release this month :)|||1||
1038954601|pi|Something for the self-compilers|M.A.S.H. has released <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/" target=_blank>MameInfo Source 0.62</a>. It's a patch for the 0.62 source which allows proper MameInfo.dat and Driver.dat information. Still no sign of a FMAME32 release.|||1||

1038954632|pi|Next step, CPS2|After some pause, here we have more <a href="http://cottage.emuunlim.com/status.htm" target=_blank>CottAGE WIP</a>. David Raingeard and Romain Tisserand sent in two soundchip emulators which are the used in pre-Qsound CPS1 games. Actually they also sent a small Java player which can play the SF2 samples! Sounds great, certainly. CPS1 in Java? Maybe...|||1||
1038954647|pi|Playing the game name|Another mistery at <a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>Haze's MAME Page</a>, but this time it was easy to discover (besides it has been revealed already). He has been playing with the Sega Titan-Video (ST-V) BIOS, but claims that he might not go further since it's too much for him. Talking about revelations, Logiqx has an idea for <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's mistery</a>, he says it could be Tenth Degree. He was already right with the CoJag games. Any bets?|||1||
1039013615|pi|More emulation for palm devices|Jeff Mitchell, author of <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/linux/xcade_unix.shtml" target=_blank>Xcade for Unix<a> and its DOS port five years ago, has released at his CodeJedi page <a href="http://www.codejedi.com/" target=_blank>XCade 1.1 for Palm OS</a>, claiming to be the first arcade emulator for this platform. According to the website, it only runs in the latest Palm OS devices like Palm Tungsten T and the Sony NX series. For now it runs Space Invaders, Pacman and MS. Pacman, and Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr., plus games in similar hardware. Right now I am unsure if the emu is shareware or the registration is optional, or even if it's crippled in any way. Thanks to Stiletto for covering this emu I totally missed!|||1||

1039125204|pi|Massive update|<a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a> has released today a lot of datfiles, some new, some changed, many updated from the last MAME release and the last XOR's of yesterday.

1039125227|pi|Baby Jack ate my brain|You should visit <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a>. Today it had a big update, and Sixtoe has decided to add a new manufacturer museum: Midway. It includes Williams and Bally/Sente. No pinball action, but surely lots of goodies in it.

You can email them directly to John IV, use your imagination and don't ask for MS4 or other silly things.<br><br>On another bright idea, the MAME32 QA team has released another MAME32 0.62 for AMD K6 processors, since the other release seemed to not want to work with them.

First, the M1 SDKs for Windows and Linux. They include headers for the M1 core and source of the frontends, but no actual source of M1. Second, new ZiNc renderers, OpenGL and D3D for Windows, and MesaGL for Linux, all courtesy of Pete Bernert. Now you can disable the keys used by the renderer, plus the D3D has no debug keys anymore. No new Glide plugin? Bleh :) Me wants!|||1||

Warning, the walkthroughs and certain gameplay infos have been deleted. I agree with the statement, and anyway things like cheats and eastern eggs seem to stay :)|||1||
1039128400|pi|Bad check&neverget|I almost overlooked the release of <a href="http://www.emucamp.com/laser/" target=_blank>Laser 0.20a</a>. Metafox included the fix for Lupin III by ss_teven. That seems to be the only change, but the good news is that he is again at it after a long pause. He mentions he will start to add games based on requests made on the forums, so well I guess we will see more updates soon.|||1||

Later today, a friend recommended me some whois and reverse dns lookup services at <a href="http://www.samspade.org/t/" target=_blank>Sam Spade Tools</a>. It's interesting to see his view about <a href="http://www.samspade.org/d/persfire.html" target=_blank>personal firewalls</a>, he has an <a href="http://www.samspade.org/d/firewalls.html" target=_blank>in-deep discussion about them</a>, and provides a link to a <a href="http://cyberpunks.org/display/356/article/" target=_blank>very interesting article</a>. I don't know how much of all this is true, but makes me look the whole thing under a new perspective. I'll do some more research and if things keep looking the same, I'll uninstall my snake oil.<br><br>On the other hand, I had some nice advice from Logiqx about <a href="http://www.argosoft.com/" target=_blank>ArGoSoft Mail Server</a>, a freeware POP3/SMTP server which I use now for outbounding emails from my addy. I also found some great DNS for my dynamic IP at <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/" target=_blank>No-IP.com</a>, five for free and the update client is small but nice and almost full featured. I'd recommend the servebeer.com one :) Now I only want to change to something similar to <a href="http://www.eprompter.com/" target=_blank>ePrompter</a> because it doesn't allow me to set different times for each email account. Still I've used it for a lot of time with my dial-up and works great, but... I want something else. Any recommendation?|||1||

I also saw the good looking preview of a coming OpenGL version (tho the preview doesn't look like any game at all). Like Erik said, it doesn't look like Java!|||1||

There is also this Area 51 / Maximum Force Duo game, with a CHD of 1.6gb, not playable on most computers like all the CoJag games but still I bet it will cause massive bandwidth consumption. There are snaps of more games, like two japanese quiz for the Jaleco Megasystem 32, and Avengers in Galactic Storm, none of these working well yet, but on their way. Plus there are quite some good fixes and improvements here and there, for example <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/8859/" target=_blank>Shiriru</a> is still fixing the CPS2 driver, lots of clones and raster effects in Edward Randy got fixed too.|||1||

At least he got time to contribute to <a href="http://www.cinemarcade.com/gametime.html" target=_blank>The Games that Time Forgot</a>, with a review of Nova 2001 (a quite nice shooter IMHO). Still Aaron's update is interesting to read, as usual.|||1||

Pay a visit and enjoy the endings of all those games you never finished!|||1||
1044115012|pi|Re-release again|ElSemi has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula 2.22a</a>. It's not the same as the "leaked" 2.22 version, so don't be confused; redownload. It has quite a lot of fixes, including crashing on 32bit desktops (like mine) and the infamous step fram in the shots factory. It also includes an option similar to the Kawaks WinAmp Jukebox, and I think this one has some good possibilities. It works with WinAmp Classic, heh :) Oh check also his D3D blitter, it has an enhanced version of FBA's FishBowl with reflections and all... Too bad, again my Voodoo will not do :/|||1||

He will keep maintaining GeoMAME, tho. Oh don't worry, he got <a href="http://mac.emuscene.com/" target=_blank>Lucas Newman</a> who will maingain CPSMAME from now on.

Ok, not in an every day basis, but I think it's as quick as it was before (no, not like in the golden days, but the past always looks better than it was).

I just thought I'd write a quick post to say that although Pi isn't posting news at the moment (maybe he will be back in due course) the emulator information is still being updated behind the scenes. Information relating to MAME releases is normally updated at about the same time as data files on logiqx.com and other things get updated sooner or later (most often later though, due to work and other interests). Today I have updated the Daphne, Kawaks and RAINE pages so all of the main emulators are now up to date. I also added ASTGL, DSP and Xor World pages because they've been waiting patiently for months! Lastly, I went through all of the emulator status information (active, dormant, etc) and also updated the recent/recommended/nonmame emulator lists a little.|||1||

It summarizes what we all have been seeing in the last years of arcade, there's really nothing new. Still the article is quite interesting so I suggest you to read it. Note that the article only mentions slightly emulation as a negative influence ^_^<br><br>To add things to the demise of arcade industry, Sammy has finished his hostile takeover of Sega. After getting around 25% of shares of Sega, now Sammy is appointing its own <a href="http://spong.com/detail/news.asp?prid=6201" target=_blank>CEO Hajime Satomi as chairman of Sega</a>. The news mention that Sega is gonna make more business and money under Sammy's direction, but again this means it will leave behind all the gaming quality we're used to. Will they keep doing arcade? Games for consoles? <a href="http://spong.com/detail/news.asp?prid=6202&type=n" target=_blank>SEGA's reactionary statement</a> doesn't answer these questions, and nothing points to a positive answer.

It has the usual batch of fixes and improvements here and there, but for me the most remarkable new feature is "Mark NoDumps as Unneeded". Listen people: having dummy files for nodump roms is bad. It makes some games unplayable. I suggest you to get the new ClrMamePro and get rid of them ASAP, and better now than later, emergency action recommended.

Megadriver is a brazilian heavy metal band devoted to videogame music (actual quote). The news is that they have made a heavy metal style remake of the <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/multi/mame/goldnaxe.shtml" target=_blank>Golden Axe</a>, they're releasing the music for free, and they are distributed an altered MAME to include support for that soundtrack in the game!

1081004852|pi|Werk in Prowess|Gridle has made another big update of the <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a>. Since these changes are more recent, I'll comment some. First, the absolutely awesome submission by Olivier Galibert, a preliminary Sega Model 1 driver with four games (not working or anything close). This is for people who said that Model 3 emulation would come first ^_^ Now it's a race to see who finishes first, lol. Raiden 2 sprites partially decrypted (wow), with a better I386 CPU core, ZN and related driver updates, and a lot more. While the rest is a bit outdated, you'll have the opportunity to see the shots of some of these games for first time, like me...<br><br>Yesterday R. Belmont gave us a little teaser for that <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/rbelmont/hfa.html" target=_blank>Model 1 emulation WIP</a>, and today he gives more teasers for <a href="http://rbelmont.nm.ru/tps.html" target=_blank>Tecmo PS WIP</a>, which is the ZN version of Tecmo.

No signs of sound are mentioned...<br><br>And even more at <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~pjb118/wip.html" target=_blank>Phil Bennet's MAME WIP</a>, that Microprose stuff is hard but he's getting some results already.|||1||
1081109383|pi|I am the sandwich|R. Belmont keeps his front page untouched, and putting special WIP shots in separate pages. This time it's about a guy who used to say <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/rbelmont/thelaw.html" target=_blank>I am the law</a>.|||1||

However look at the cute rodent in the title screen, isn't it lovely?<br><br>News posted at <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron's Home Page</a>.

He says it has hacks, but seeing how nasty is the ST-0016 (an approach to Konami's techniques) it can be understandable. Still the pictures don't have any obvious glitch so he's on the good track.<br><br><a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>Haze's MAME Page</a> has been updated with a screen from Landing Gear (check <a href="http://www.system16.com/taito/hrdw_jc.html#lg" target=_blank>System 16's Taito JC System</a> page for some shock).

1084488245|pi|Free advertising|Bobby Tribble has updated <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>'s unMAMEd arcade games</a> to be in sync with MAME 0.82; you get the usual batch of removals and moving around. He mentions he's busy with real life so there is not any other updates. Still this site is full of information and screens from non emulated games so it's always nice to mention about it.|||1||
1084488269|pi|The lords of metal|Nino Megadriver has released <a href="http://www.metalmame.com/" target=_blank>Metal Mame 0.05-80</a> to celebrate the opening of the new site dedicated exclusively for this heavy metal remix of MAME. I guess you already know about what this does, so I'll just mention that now it supports four games: Metal Beast, Metal Contra, Metal Axe and Speed Metal Gyruss. The sound kits are there to download, with the binary and sources.|||1||
1084488283|pi|Run, Forrest, run!|The people over at GeoShock has released <a href="http://www.geoshock.com/" target=_blank>FastMAME 0.82</a>. There's not much to say about this since it doesn't have any difference with MAME, except that it is compiled with so many optimization flags that the UN building entrance looks desert. The compiler used gives a nice speed boost for the majority of games, this makes it my current choice for playing games ^_^|||1||
1084488300|pi|One minute warning|Haze has just released <a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.82u1</a>. The first micro release of the current 0.82 "cycle" (remember there are not beta test cycles anymore) contains a few nice things worth remarking, like that lot of Sega Titan-Video fixes from Mariusz Wojcieszek and a few new games working like Bloody Roar 2. Oh well, check the <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=145556&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post145556" target=_blank>whatsnew.txt</a> by yourself (kindly posted by R.

1085521095|pi|For now that's how things are going to be|Well I think that was enough for now. As you can guess, lately I'm having a big problem with motivation, or better said, the lack of it. I am not doing news as I did before, so basically I'm an echo of the <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=news" target=_blank>News Submission board</a>, just with better quality english. And nowadays it's true (never so true as before) that most of the news are MAME related, and for that <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>MameWorld</a> is doing a great job. No, don't worry, for now I'll make the odd post about things non MAME, since I'm aware that many projects don't have the public light they deserve.

1085521122|pi|But, I have something else to say today...|The last news I've received are from Alessandro Scotti (sorry for the delay). He has released <a href="http://www.ascotti.org/programming/tickle/tickle.htm" target=_blank>Tickle 0.91</a>.

It has about 20 games, and the latest version includes a new frontend for the Linux port, experimental force feedback (with Space Invaders!) and fixes everywhere. Try it!|||1||

Although it's not as big or <i>accurate</i> as the Borg, it's one of my favorite emulators and I still use it to play certain games in my ghettoputer(tm). There are lots of fixes, updated hiscore.dat, and a bunch of new games like Caliber 50, Daioh and Zombie Raid. Unfortunately, no new games not in MAME. And also unfortunately, there's a lot of code needing rewriting, so it will pass a long time until a new version comes out, if it ever comes...|||1||
1086261462|pi|But I'm still missing one of the requirements...|Want to have a whole collection of classic arcade cabs in your room? <a href="http://www.wayoftherodent.com/gd101/bs_paperarcade.htm" target=_blank>Paper Arcade</a> will help you.

I was expecting this, just a bugfix release, but here it is. The good thing is that (if I read correctly) they have stopped using Allegro and now they use SDL for sound under linux and win32. I still expect a couple more "bugfixes" before the rewrite, if any... Thanks to The Informer for posting this.|||1||
1086823487|pi|Resurrection|Peale has taken the old VAntAGE code (look at <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/multi/vantage.shtml" target=_blank>our VAntAGE page</a>) and he is trying, with the help of some friends, to <a href="http://www.arcadecontrols.org/yabbse/index.php?board=3;action=display;threadid=14020" target=_blank>add new drivers</a>. For now there's a varying degree of success, but there's interest and potential there. VAntAGE is capable of running classics in very old hardware, so you could build a vertical cab with minimal costs. I wish them luck and I hope to hear from this project again very soon.|||1||

If you're in much need of zero-minute arcade news, visit <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>MameWorld</a>, its News Submission board, or any general emu board...<br><br>First, an old favorite of mine with a new release: <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/" target=_blank>ScummVM 0.6.1</a>. The main stuff on this release is the amount of bugs fixed and a few functionalities added. Thanks to RetroK for the news.<br><br>Erik Duijs is still developing <a href="http://movegaga.nl/80s/" target=_blank>JEmu2</a>. A few bugs have been sorted out, but it still plays the same five classics. Not that it was bad, but I was expecting a couple of new supported gems. Java, OpenGL, blah blah blah. Must try it! And then, "clap your hands".<br><br>And finally a new release/rewrite of ElSemi's infamous beast, <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula Model 2 v0.1 alpha</a>. This rewrite needs Direct-X 9, but uses a lighter (faster?) framework. And has good words from a few knowledgeable guys. Thanks to Tourniquet for the prompt news.|||1||
1090968921|pi|Correction:|Erik Duijs just wrote me to tell me big news: Bomb Jack, Donkey Kong Jr, and Hexa have just been added to the <a href="http://www.movegaga.nl/80s" target=_blank>JEmu2</a> page. They're playable and amazingly, two thirds of the new games have sound. Soon more games will have internet score too. I just hope he doesn't slip in and add cheats too ^_^|||1||
1091381498|logiqx|A few updates|I have updated a few emulators inside CAESAR. I have added ElSemi's new <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/multi/segamodel2emulator.shtml">SEGA Model 2 Emulator</a> and also updated the pages for <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/sound/nebula_jukebox.shtml">Nebula Jukebox</a>, <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/sound/neojukebox.shtml">NeoJukeBox</a> and <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/sound/qplayer.shtml">QPlayer</a> (now that I have created accurate data files for them).

1091777042|logiqx|New snapshots|For a long time now the MAME screenshots in CAESAR have been rather incomplete and I've wanted to start using a more complete collection. Well, I've finally managed to find the time to make the changes required so that I can use the <a href="http://crashtest.retrogames.com/">CrashTest</a> collection. I have also introduced his snaps for a few of the other emulators.

1092063209|pi|Summer temperatures = lazy newsposters|I hope you've noticed the release of <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.85</a> (without alias for now). The <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> has some juicy new input stuff, courtesy of Mr. Aaron Giles. Of course it's still full of other great contributions. Check it. There have been many builds updated, included <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com/mame32qa/" target=_blank>MAME32 0.85</a> and all the usual dats, packs and stuff.<br><br>Still, no FastMAME which is the one I want right now ^_^ Logiqx is also away, walking over water or stuff like that.

1092669534|pi||Well, Mr. <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx</a> is back from holidays, and he has already issued a lot of datfile updates.

1092728029|logiqx|MAME v0.85|I have done the usual updates at the back end so that all of the MAME details are up to date now. CrashTest has also done a huge amount of work for his latest MAME snapshots (WIP release for 0.85u2) and there are no games without snapshots now!|||1||

Besides consolidating the input changes from 0.85 and correcting lots of related bugs, you can witness the addition of a new interesting cores: PowerPC 403. The fixes for Hyperstone and 37710 cores add up for a release which doesn't contain any new working games, but has preliminary drivers for games such as Silent Scope, Gradius IV, GTI Club and other PPC games. Which do nothing, but they're there anyway ^_^ Virtua Racing and SPI also have some improvements, and I'm sure some classics will come very soon (maybe in 0.86u1).<br><br>Of course, all this was possible due to rom dumps; speaking of that, Mr. Goodwraith made another status update of the <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=154604&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post154604" target=_blank>Dumping Project</a>, so remember that the keyword is still <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/donate.htm" target=_blank>donate, donate and donate</a>. |||1||

1093437448|logiqx|Updates behind the scenes|I have improved the aspect ratio correction for screenshots and games that have multiple screens or have cropped screenshots should now be correct. On top of that, I have also updated the manufacturer list (added Greyhound Electronics, Sigma Enterprises, SunA, Video System Co. and unknown). Snapshots for MAME have now been updated to CrashTest's v0.86 release and the MAME information has also been updated to v0.86.

Pretty much as Charles McDonald's method of reading the protected CPU's, but geared towards any kind of chip. It uses a combination of custom hardware to link the pcb's and software to drive the tests.

1109512115|pi|In high fidelity|Well, after breaking three fingers in the works, Aaron finally finished the sound system rewriting and this morning we got <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.93 "Seibu SPI decryption"</a>! Of course, the stars in the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> are Aaron's sound system rewrite and Nicola's decrypting graphics on Seibu SPI games, which includes some great Raiden shooters. There are various fixes all around too, and besides the SPI games, you can also play now Ufo Senshi Yohko Chan and hear sound in Tank8. And as Haze says, "please test this release extensively."|||1||
1109549563|logiqx|An easy life...|Well, MAME v0.93 has got to have been the easiest update ever for me in regards data files and CAESAR! Nothing affected the supplementary data files and there weren't any game renames or ROM changes to affect the CAESAR groupings. Such an easy update only happens once every couple of years it seems! Anyway, that's a long way to say that CAESAR is up to date.|||1||

If you don't get it by the name, I'll tell you that the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> includes Aaron changes which make almost all the Sega Y-board games work nicely. You'll also find a lot of sound fixes needed due to the update in last version to the sound system, and those three SemiCom games. Updates all around as usual, enjoy this release.|||1||
1110134386|logiqx|The weekly update!|Just a week since MAME v0.93 was released and v0.94 has arrived already. I've updated the information in CAESAR and also done the necessary work for Kawaks v1.54.|||1||

Indian Battle has been acquired and tested, so we can expect to see it by ourselves soon. More games are in the way too. However there's a new batch of PCB's on target right now, and as usual we (the arcade emulation community) are asking to you (the arcade emulation individual user) a little donation to help with these purchases. I did a donation in the beginning of the month so I'm out for a while, but you could contribute. Doesn't need to be big bucks, 10 or 20 could do. Even something as small as $5! Come on, you know you want to <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/donate.htm" target=_blank>donate</a>!|||1||
1110894237|pi|Time to worry about other things|Well, no more worries.

1111951473|pi|Liar liar|Well, sorry for the lack of posting, I've been enjoying some holidays away from the computer (i.e. in the living room), but I'm back to report the release of <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.95 "Konami Curling"</a>. Of course, the most remarkable part of the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> is the addition of working Nagano Winter Olympics '98 including curling. The rest of the changelog is not of any importance for me, so I'll let you read it by yourself. Enjoy *_^|||1||
1112122858|pi|Pringles arrived|Well, I am still trying to recover from the shock of overlooking the release of <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.42.4</a>. And then another shocking shock shocked me. Can you guess? Yes, it's <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a>. Sure it's kind of old, but Santeri says that <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=170831&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post170831" target=_blank>one month at a time</a> is the actual schedule.

1113516550|pi|Good while it lasted|Sad news for me, because <a href="http://haze.mameworld.info/" target=_blank>Haze is retiring as MAME maintainer</a>. He has been a great maintainer IMHO, and has taken MAME several steps forward, easing and agilizing the development of this great emulator. He'll keep doing drivers, but now he's handing the maintenance job to <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>Aaron Giles</a>, so the project is still in good hands, we'll soon get to see how Aaron shapes the work.<br><br>On another topic, there's something strange happening at <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a>.

1114030415|pi|Sad news from the penguin|After Haze left the MAME maintaining job to Aaron, Tux is doing the same with <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE</a>. Read his post where he's saying that <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/msgboard/yabbse/index.php?topic=1034.0" target=_blank>he's not developing in RAINE anymore</a>. The sad thing is that there's no one else to maintain it from now on. He says he might do the odd maintenance release but no more serious developing. This means that one of my favorite emulators is going to hibernate until who knows when. In any case, many thanks to him for all this work with RAINE, he has pushed it to new levels. Hopefully, someone will want to take the chore, but until then, sleep well, my beloved emu!|||1||
1114727680|pi|Neodammerung|<a href="http://www.come.to/blastar" target=_blank>Blastar</a> has made a new homebrew NeoGeo CD game: Codename - Blut Engel. It can be burned and played in your NeoCD console, or played thru an emulator. It's a shooter with simple graphics, but somehow I always find homebrew games in arcade hardware as "very cute" or better. Try it.|||1||
1115146701|pi|The end of the jokes|In Aaron's hands, the project has breeded its last creature, namely <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.96</a> (no nickname yet). Updates available at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a>. Checking the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a>, I noticed that Boogie Wings has been promoted from NON_WORKING. That really ends the need of reading the whatsnew for me, so I'm off to updating MAME, the needed roms, and check the very last game I had any curiosity into... Until TGM2 ^_^ Oh btw, please notice this is the very first official version with the license changed to the new BSD based license. Be good.|||1||

This is the first fully functional and completely playable version of this remake of the 3DO version of the classic Star Control II. I've been playing it for awhile and it's truly great. Somewhere in the middle of Star Control, Elite and Noctis (if you know them). By all means, this is a highly recommended game with a big dose of retro feel, good music and deep gameplay. Try it!|||1||
1117743825|pi|The will of gawd|Aaron has pushed together all the submissions and released promptly on the beginning of this month <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.97</a> (no nickname yet, no binaries available yet). Updates available at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a> as expected. Checking the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> in a near future will reveal almost no changes, all of them happened in the u1-u4 cycle. The most famous change is controversial, so I'll only mention that the random resets of Galaxian have been fixed. Enjoy the release.|||1||

If you remember how to do such thing between jumping over evil mushrooms and obliterating entire armies of alien ships, then go ahead.

Updates available at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a> as usual. The <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> shows a good amount of bugs fixed, some interesting new games (Slipstream, X-Men 6p) and some really good improvements like the revamping in the Taito F3 driver. Good one for the summer!|||1||
1122720661|pi|Ready to serve|So, years and years and years of research, engineering and development are finished. CAESAR goes PHP, hats off to Logiqx for this awesome work. You can read the <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=37" target=_blank>announcement</a>. There are some new features in the pages, but I guess the most remarkable feature is a game search function. Although quite simple, it's also flexible if you handle it properly. I.e. searching for games containing "vs" in the name, "capcom" in the manufacturer and a year beginning with "199" gives all the Capcom VS fighters of the 90's (plus Alien vs Predator, but oh well). There is also new information in the game pages and everything stays cross-referenced among hundreds of arcade emulators and thousands of games...

It has even online hi-scores! Right now there are 28 games available, with some rumours of this number rising in a not too distant future. There's also a rumour of a 68k core coming soon too, which would multiply the possibilities... Don't forget to check Cosmic Trip too, a 3D shooter worth a look.|||1||

You can get binaries and stuff at mame.net or source only at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a>. The <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> shows some interesting things. For example, Aaron hooked up the cassette sample for Journey, isn't that cute? And as the name of the release suggests, the DECO 156 encryption has been emulated, allowing some good classicts to be playable. There's also a warning about the numbering of next version. But it doesn't matter how many times do we explain it, people will still scream for 1.0!|||1||
1124234375|pi|Can you hear me?|Erik Duijs has released a new version of <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2</a>. This new version has YM2203 emulation, which gives sound to Commando, 1943 & 1943 Kai and Gun Smoke. Furthermore, there's a new Arkanoid driver, complete with sound and preliminary mouse support. JEmu2, the most mentioned emu in CAESAR in the last month, also has new support for War of the Bugs, Sonson, Mario Bros, and the classic favorite Scramble. Remember you can play JEmu2 almost anywhere, isn't that neat? ^_^|||1||

This (or these) new version(s) have almost 100 more new games, including beauties like Daytona 2. Also, he has told me that the roms and sets should match with MAME and PinMAME, which is a plus. Tons of fixes including last minute bug pruning in the 0.7.6 version. No doubt this is one of the best emulators out there. <br><br>And, do you know about <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>TGM2</a>? ^_^|||1||
1125307268|pi|Un ingles vino a Bilbao...|Well, apparently we (barely) survived the weekend here and Logiqx is back to Britland to continue the work. <br><br>Tux is slowly but steadily releasing new versions of a supposedly dormant emulator (something I love, btw), so here we have <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.43.0</a>! Rebuilt from scratch with the latest tools and libs (the Windows version, that's it), and with a very interesting changelog with new games like Super Pang, sound in NMK004 games, simultaneous wav and png logging (to make videos!) and even artwork support. Including many good fixes and some changes here and there, this is a good release which all of us can enjoy.<br><br>And Erik Duijs has also released a new version of his emulator in Java, <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.4</a>. I could go mentioning everything which is new (like Lode Runner, Kung-Fu Master [!] new scanline and Scale2x renderers, performance improvements, and some fixes) but everything pales in comparison with the addi(c)tion of Ghost 'n Goblins with sound. Have you heard me? Ghost 'n Goblins emulation online, anywhere! Almost almost as good as the Solomon's Key support ^_^|||1||

There are many good things since the last "official" release, including some core and framework changes. But I'd like to point out the amount of bugfixes and improvements in many drivers and cores. People who say that devs are only interested in adding new games, and not in fixing old bugs or improve existing drivers, should get a clue. Well, this is mainly because there aren't so many games dumped and easy to emulate, so what's left is the hard stuff ^_^ Anyway enjoy this release, and don't pay too much attention to the version number ;)|||1||

On the <a href="http://potato.emu-france.com/" target=_blank>PotatoMulti</a> side, CPS1 is already working. Although the screenshots say "Sega Genesis Emulator", you can see games like Cadillac & Dinosaurs or The Punisher running perfectly (according to the authors, that's it).|||1||
1127393072|pi|Slow and Barely Safe vs. The Fast & The Furious|My reaction time lately is 1-2 days, that's why I'm also late for reporting <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.43.2</a>. It has new games, Haze added three and Tux added five more, including the Multi Champ games. There are a lot more fixes, specially for Linux dudes & dudettes.|||1||
1127805299|pi|Three shorties|Yesterday it was released <a href="http://www.daphne-emu.com/" target=_blank>DAPHNE 0.99.7</a>, with support for Dragon's Lair 2, Mach 3, Us vs Them, Roadblaster... A good release, but then again, will they go to 1.00 or to 0.100? Oh the doubt, oh the future (j/k). Get the changelog and binaries at the <a href="http://www.daphne-emu.com/download/" target=_blank>DAPHNE Download Page</a>. And Erik Duijs wrote me again to tell me about <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.6</a>, which can run Street Fighter II nicely. There are cryptic news about a new, faster binary uploaded, and a promised new 68k core which will be even faster. Also, I'd like to mention an update at <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games</a>, fortunately the removed games are more than the added ones ^_^|||1||
1128162465|pi|Thanks for everything|After years of hard work in The Dumping Project, <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=181675&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post181675" target=_blank>Mr. Goodwraith has decided to retire</a>. I want to express my deepest thanks for his work on finding and preserving really rare stuff in danger of disappearing. And why not, also for getting more cool games to play ^_^ Now the MAME Targets was substituted this same week by <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/gurudumps/DumpingProject/index.html" target=_blank>The Wanted Dumps List</a> managed by The Guru, and you can still <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/donate.htm" target=_blank>donate to The Dumping Project</a> as usual.<br>|||1||
1128316872|pi|Double moka with cpscream|I received two news about updated Java emus in a very short period of time, maybe it's a sign of the good shape of the Java side of emulation, or maybe it's just coincidence... In any case, Gollum told me about more <a href="http://cottage.consolemul.com/" target=_blank>PotatoMulti</a> news, you can see more Z80 based games in the WIP page, like Black Tiger, the Donkey Kong saga and some Lode Runners among others. They're polishing the emulator for an inminent release, so be ready. And Erik Duijs just released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.6.1</a>. No new games, but now you have configurable input (a really useful feature in any emulator), and a faster CPS1 driver.|||1||
1128929396|pi|2 weeks earlier than I expected|Yesterday it was released <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.101 "Namco FL and DBZ VRVS"</a>. Binaries are ready and the <a href="http://mamedev.com/releases/whatsnew_0101.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> is there too. Source code and documentation also at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a> as usual. Along the usual updates and additions, you get Dragonball Z V.R.V.S. working (ugh), and also Golden Axe - The Duel. Worth noting is also the new automatic state saving and loading, which allows you to mimic the behaviour of never turning off the game, saving hi-scores and allowing for time-released features and stuff. Will this be the demise of hiscore.dat? Probably. A good release but still too early for my bday ^_^|||1||
1129376831|pi|Strange fishes in the aquarium|Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.6.2</a>. While it still has the same old name, and doesn't have any new game supported, this version has added the famous "fishbowl effect". It's a 3D rendering of the screen deformed to look like the good old curved arcade screens. You can check how it looks in <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=retrogen&Number=82792&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post82792" target=_blank>this post</a>, or better, you can try it by yourself visiting his site.|||1||
1129578449|pi|Solomon &amp; Dangerous|Gollum wrote me about the <a href="http://cottage.consolemul.com/" target=_blank>CottAGE/PotatoMulti</a> front. There's a first version you can try at the <a href="http://www.game-oldies.com/?m=list&a=viewlist&machine=arcade&page=0-9&view=thumb" target=_blank>Game-Oldies site</a>. This first version has 54 games, including the newly supported Commando and Solomon's Key. And I'd also like to mention <a href="http://www.bigorno.net/xrick/" target=_blank>xrick</a>, a rewrite of the Rick Dangerous engine. One of my favorite platformers of all time. Great!|||1||
1129989546|pi|The return of the CottAGE|Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2/index.html" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.7</a>. This new version raises the total number of games up to 50. There are 12 new games like Eyes, Ponpoko and Van-Van Car. So now it has 20 games with hi-scores and 22 with full sound, not bad with an emulator with that name ^_^ He is also announcing a CottAGE release very soon.|||1||
1130768586|pi|Nicholas & Thomas|Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2/index.html" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.8</a>. The main features of this release are a new 68k core (supposedly better, I guess) and the addition of Snow Bros., one of my all-time favorite platformers. He has also released <a href="http://cottage.consolemul.com/" target=_blank>CottAGE 1.6</a>, which is not available yet in the official site, but you can get it in the JEmu2 page (above) with some notes about it.|||1||
1131065217|pi|Database On Arrival|Another victim of the PHP fever, <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a> was updated and also transformed into a powerful PHP database engine... With search! Ohhh search within System 16... Now I'm happy (for the nest 3 minutes). Great.|||1||
1131881956|pi|More CPS2 Java goodness|Gollum just wrote me about the most recent WIP in <a href="http://cottage.consolemul.com/" target=_blank>PotatoArcade</a> . CPS-2 is working, and as the saying goes, images are worth 850 words (ah, the inflation) so take a look at the status page. Some of the games are Marvel Vs. Capcom, DD: SoM, Mars Matrix & Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. Additionally, there's preliminary support for the classic Pang. You can try the current version at the  <a href="http://www.game-oldies.com/" target=_blank>Game-Oldies site</a>.|||1||
1131965920|pi|The hornet is here|It has been released just today: <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.102 "Gradius 4"</a>. Binaries are ready and the <a href="http://mamedev.com/releases/whatsnew_0102.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> is up to read too. Source code and documentation also at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a> as usual. I guess the star in this release is Gradius 4, in a working Konami Hornet driver which already has another game. There has been also a big change in the memory system, but I'm not sure of which were their effects. This release is as juicy as usual. And Logiqx will be pleased to know it was released the same day he left for 2 weeks... ^_^|||1||
1133464155|pi|Sloth, sloth, sloth...|Slow news lately, uh? Well, Tormod has added an article about <a href="http://home.online.no/~tjaberg/" target=_blank>The Art Of CPS2 Battery Maintenance</a> which explains pretty well how to change battery for those depressed, suicidal CPS2 boards. I'm willing to take a CPS2 board with a game and a JAMMA cabinet to fully test the steps provided by the article ^_^<br><br>In other, more informal news, someone in some boards (forgot who, sorry) posted a link about an interesting and fun article about <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-10735-Robot+PacMan+(IREX+2005).html" target=_blank>The Pac-Man Robot</a>.|||1||
1133809911|pi|After a long, long weekend...|Well, let's see what I've been missing lately. First, there was a nice update at <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a>. Quite enough new stuff to keep you entertained, and there's one which outstands by its weirdness: Renaming CPS2 to CP System II? Looks ugly, no matter how exact it is ^_^<br><br>More on CPS news, we got <a href="http://cps2shock.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Kawaks 1.55</a> released over at CPS-2 Shock. Inline with the MAME drivers, and adding the new XORed Super Puzzle Fighter II clone, plus supporting some more hacks and bootlegs. There seems to be a bug in command-line usage so maybe there'll be a fix release soon, stay tuned.<br><br>And to finish the round of news, Erik wrote me about some <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2/index.html" target=_blank>CottAGE WIP</a>. He's substituting the old, MAME-like drivers with new, fresh, better ones. He also told me other things, so congratulations ;)|||1||
1135350824|pi|New, better versions|Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2/index.html" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.9</a>. It's packed with quite many fixes, along with a good performance boost (claiming to be up to 50% in some cases). There are four new games, including Jr. Pacman with online high score support (great!) Many of the old CottAGE drivers have been replaced with new, better ones, although the work in that area hasn't finished yet.<br><br>Also, please allow me to pimp my new little utility <a href="http://www.euskalnet.net/pits/dupecrcdetect/" target=_blank>DupeCRCDetect 0.5.2</a>. It allows to detect and manage duplicated files. It's small but I think it does what it has to do in a nice way and with enough features to be useful. This release is supposedly bug-free, isn't that a bonus? ^_^|||1||
1135948260|pi|The hour 103|Well, Aaron gave us a New Year gift and released <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAME 0.103</a>. Binaries should be ready anytime at <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a>. Since I'm busy enjoying the end of year (programming), I'll not discuss much about the <a href="http://mamedev.com/releases/whatsnew_0103.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a>, althought I guess I can comment that the star this time is a huge STV improvement which makes a lot of games playable in high-end machines. This is also probably the last new post of the year, so on behalf of Logiqx and me, Happy New Year everyone!|||1||
1136312774|pi|The good, the bad, and the littletinywiny|Sixtoe has updated <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a>. I guess that no matter how big the updates are, everyone has noticed that finally he added SNK NeoGeo MVS hardware ^_^<br><br>On other, smaller, saltless news, I've created a little application which loads a MAME-style XML file and allows you to filter out games based on a configurable filter, using number of players, cocktail support, etc. I've made a first public release of <a href="http://pi.logiqx.com/msieve/" target=_blank>MSieve 0.1</a> for testing, although I do plan to improve it and make a second release one of these days.|||1||
1139063708|pi|The bear is asleep|After some time not paying attention to anything in the cold kilt emu sk3n3, I've noticed the release of <a href="http://www.smallnews.net/azuco/" target=_blank>Hornet 060131</a>. This is supposedly a Konami Hornet emulator (see the <a href="http://www.system16.com/konami/hrdw_hornet.html" target=_blank>System 16 page</a> devoted to this system). But according to the experiences of some people, it still doesn't do anything. <br><br>And Erik released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 2.1</a>, with many fixes specially in the MSX part.<br><br>Now back to my hibernation. See you in spring ^_^|||1||
1141580037|pi|The late night Douglas Adams' show|Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 2.3</a>. This new version has the ability to be played as an applet, if you want. The other improvements are MSX related, with a few more games and better MSX-2 support (that's deluxe, you know).|||1||
1141672483|pi|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Legal ROMs|There's an arcade game which has been released as free (and for non-commercial usage) at <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.org</a>. As Aaron explains, the author of <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/roms/alienar/" target=_blank>Alien Arena</a> has decided to release this creation which was essentially homebrew in its nature. But homebrew arcade games weren't so common back in 1984! Maybe not the best game ever, but a little piece of arcade history and a completely legal ROM to download and enjoy.|||1||
1141766748|pi|Sad|Too bad, <a href="http://www.starroms.com/" target=_blank>StarROMs closes its doors</a>. It means that the one and only current dealer of legal ROMs for selling is stopping activities after more than 2 years. I hope others continue where they left, and I wish good luck in any endeavour to the brave business men who founded StarROMs.|||1||
1142858937|pi|St. Patrick's Edition|Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2" target=_blank>JEmu2 3.0</a>, which I call "St. Patrick's Edition". The main change in this new version is the addition of Sega Master System, with support for online high scores in seven of them. Enjoy!|||1||
1144168394|pi|The spanish version of the english version|Finally, after almost 2 months, <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target=_blank>MAME 0.105</a> has been released. You can get the official Windows binaries at <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a>, and notice they're not compressed with UPX anymore. The amount of core changes is very big, you can check them in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0105.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a>, if you've not been aware in this long u cycle (up to u9). There have been many fixes to old bugs, and some new games made their way. Including Trivial Pursuit (Spanish Edition) thanks to Manuel Abadia ^_^|||1||
1145019639|pi|Do the cheat|After 2 years, and again in April, there's an update at <a href="http://cheat.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Pugsy's MAME Cheat Page</a>. Update? No, I mean massive update, we're talking more than 20 MAME versions since that last update, with cheats checked and renewed. Great!<br><br>While I'm here, I'd also like to mention this <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/space_invaders/" target=_blank>Space Invaders Emulator v0.2 for Nintendo DS</a>. The DS also has emulators!|||1||
1147700977|pi|Where's my news?|I'm sorry for being late about announcing <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target=_blank>MAME 0.106 "Fighter's History"</a>, which was released this saturday. I've been a bit on/off due to some massive hangover ^_^ Anyway, get the official Windows binaries at <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a>. The <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0106.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> isn't really exciting from my point of view, although there are a few remarkable, or at least, curious things. Like the JED files for PLD/PAL chips, and the new text for games not working... But come on, a MAME release physically smaller to the previous? Ah, that's progress... <br><br>And while you're at it, get your updated cheat.dat at <a href="http://cheat.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Pugsy's MAME Cheat Page</a>. Two updates in a row, go Pugsy!|||1||
1151786815|pi|Missiles out!|After some time without news, Erik Duijs has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2" target=_blank>JEmu2 3.3</a>. It has support for AfterBurner II, which is *great*, although he warns about the requirements of it since it's not optimized yet. Anyway these are good news, AfterBurner II is an old favorite of mine, but nothing beats playing in the cockpit...|||1||
1152022621|pi|Jet anoder hava progect|There are some news about <a href="http://www.innoveware.com/" target=_blank>JAPE 0.1 WIP</a>. Apparently it's done by Gollum, in yet another Java project. This is a more or less direct port or rewrite  of MAME 0.1, the very first version, with only 5 games. He says it's almost finished so we should expect a release soon. Thanks to Dalthon for noticing it.|||1||
1153081637|pi|The time machine|<a href="http://www.innoveware.com/" target=_blank>JAPE 0.2</a> has been released. 0.1 was released too. The difference is that one comprises almost all features from MAME 0.1, while the other is the more/less port/version of MAME 0.2. Java source and binaries available.|||1||
1153763285|pi|Mr. Giles is on fire|I'm proud to announce the release of <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank">MAME 0.107 "If it doesn't work, it's because you didn't test it enough"</a>. The name says it all, even the whatsnew.txt says that if you have problems, you should report at <a href="http://www.mametesters.org/" target="_blank">mametesters.org</a>. Of course, the big deal this time is the complete rewrite of the rendering system, which is still in testing phase although the major bugs should be out and it's much more functional than the earlier system. Multiple physical screens, for example. An easy way to manage multiscreen games through layouts is provided and already works beautifully.<br><br>If all that is not enough, you can see that there have been many fixes to old drivers too, including some rewrites from scratch to classic drivers and games. Maybe there's not much in the "new" department, but the oldies got a load of great treatment. In any case, get the official Windows binaries at <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target="_blank">mame.net</a>, and read the <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0107.txt" target="_blank">changelog</a>, this time you really should.|||1||
1153773209|pi|Wow, two news in a day!|Erik Duijs has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2" target=_blank>JEmu2 3.4</a>. This version includes full emulation of the Sega Y-Board games, like Galaxy Force 2, G-Loc, Rail Chase and the popular Power Drift (cool game which was apparently too hard for me in the cockpit). There seem to be some glitches but the thing is working beautifully already. Enjoy.|||1||
1154768036|pi|Online goodness|Erik Duijs has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2" target=_blank>JEmu2 3.5</a>. This time there is a lot of new and changed things. For example, he has merged all three frontends so MSX, SMS and arcade games are accessible from the same point. Better sound system, less memory used, fixes for some games, and other stuff. He has also added Strike Fighter, so this is an excellent release.|||1||
1155290003|pi|And now with more bang!|Some days ago, and completely unnoticed for me, <a href="http://cps2shock.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Kawaks 1.56</a> was released. It's kind of a maintenance update, where all the remaining official games in the NeoGeo system have been added, from Metal Slug 5 to SNK vs. Capcom. There are also some more CPS clones, and fixes on rom names to match MAME. Nevertheless, a good update for the completists out there.|||1||
1155468874|pi|The night after|Erik Duijs has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2" target=_blank>JEmu2 3.6</a>. This new version has a playable Space Harrier, although it doesn't have sound yet and background is missing. There are several fixes around, some more sound for games and sample support. Enjoy.|||1||
1155726034|pi|It's raining bugs|Yesterday, <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.43.4</a> was released. This is mainly a maintenance version, but IMHO with enough good reasons to make it worth it to be up-to-date. Some sets have been changed to match MAME, so a diff set should be smaller. There are a bunch of bugfixes, and the announcement that there will not be DOS binaries anymore (but you still have the ability to compile by yourself). Good gaming.|||1||
1156156255|pi|The day after (II)|Yesterday <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank">MAME 0.108</a> was released, and binaries should be available there and in <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a>. Looking at the <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0108.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> tells us that there were lots of fixes in the new rendering system (that means you didn't test enough in the 107 cycle!) There's also a new generic output system which allows external applications to know about the game state from MAME. While the amount of added games is small, the number of fixes and enhancements is quite large. Have a good one.|||1||
1156418005|pi|Modelling the games|ElSemi has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Model 2 Emulator v0.3</a> after 2 years without updates for it, and almost a year without any update from him.

There's also a mention to a stop in development until documentation for Model 2 and 2A arises, so unless someone reverse-engineers the TGP chip...|||1||
1156676088|pi|El arcade virtual|Erik Duijs released yesterday <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/jemu2/index.html" target=_blank>JEmu2 v3.7</a>, and introduced the new VirtuArcade concept. You can see VirtuArcade as a 3D frontend for JEmu2. It's not just some models of cabinets arranged, every game shown is being emulated in their screens, up to 20 at once. You choose what machine you want to play while you're seeing it working. Of course there are other enhancements for the emu, but today's feature is VirtuArcade. Note that the first run might take a while to load.|||1||
1162807329|pi|A new version|Today we got <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank">MAME 0.110</a>released, and binaries should be available there and in <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a>. The <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0110.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> shows a lot of debugger changes, hopefully making the job for developers much easier. There aren't many noteworthy game additions, but I see some Mega-Tech movement, a couple of new Trivia and Tetris games, and the spanish game Altair.|||1||
1166108656|pi|I was looking at another place...|It seems that <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank">MAME 0.111</a> has been released, without no one telling me.

The <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0111.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> includes the new CPS2 decryption tables for a few games (a step forward the proper emulation of this encryption), and LaserDisc support. This alone makes all the other changes to look smaller than they are... Beware of your hard disk with these new CHDs!|||1||
1167509518|pi|So, the emusk3n3 is not dead...|Well, Tux released yesterday <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.50.0 Pre-Release 1</a>, a kind of preview for the upcoming and heavily revamped RAINE, a personal favorite of mine. While this release is not complete, it has the main changes already implemented: a totally new graphics rendering system, different input methods, and a lot more, all specified in the post in the main page and in the <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/html/archive/NEWS-0.50.0" target=_blank>changelog</a>. Beware that the GUI can't alter yet all the new configuration options, specially in the inputs, so you'll have to tinker with config files by hand. A preview only for the brave!|||1||

1168982959|pi|It's raining emus|After a couple of prereleases, Tux has released <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.50.0-2 Final</a>. Bugs have ironed out, GUI has been polished, and what we have now is a fine-tuned and quick emulator which predates the previous versions. While there's still work ahead, the amount of changes and improvements is quite impressive, and for us retro-retrogamers and owners of ghetto-PC's, a great choice. I still use RAINE for quite a lot of games which run a bit heavy on MAME, so if you haven't tried RAINE yet, do so.|||1||
1169233527|pi|We've not finished yet|Apparently the last releases still had bugs, so here you have <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.50.1</a>. Besides some improvements regarding smart screen size choices and other bugs cleared out, they've added also the nice Multipac 1.5 rom.<br><br>And you thought the arcade sk3n3 was dead, well, now one of the members of the FBA Team got the emulation bug again, and released <a href="http://www.barryharris.me.uk/" target=_blank>FBA 0.2.96.58</a>, with unicode and non-unicode binaries besides the source. This is a huge update which brings FBA up to modern times; including the CPS2 decryption algorithm, a big lot of new games and complete clone sets, matching roms with MAME, fixed long-standing bugs... The list is quite big. While Mr. Harris doesn't promise more releases, at least FBA has been updated and can remain up-to-date for a while more.|||1||
1169680722|pi|How many arcade news can you get?|After the return of one of the FBA Team members, and getting a much needed update, Barry Harris has released another version: <a href="http://www.barryharris.me.uk/" target=_blank>FBA 0.2.96.59</a>. This one is only a bug-fix release, correcting bugs with GUI and sound, and adding yet another SF2CE clone.

And as the tradition dictates, <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank">MAME 0.112</a> was released, and binaries should be available there and in <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a> in a bit. Scouting in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0112.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a>, we see a big list of contributors. Thanks to them all! There's not much noteworthy (and I'm in a hurry right now), but HSF is included. OMG, it's the end of the sk3n3!|||1||

It includes a preliminary emulation of the Fujitsu MB86234 DSP but keep in mind that the emulation is still preliminary. There is no documentation on this chip, and it has been done by reverse engineering the binary programs and comparing with the model 2B and 2C programs and the MAME Model 1 HLE.|||1||
