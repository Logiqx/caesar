``xHi everyone. I just thought I'd write a quick post to say that although Pi isn't posting news at the moment (maybe he will be back in due course) the emulator information is still being updated behind the scenes. Information relating to MAME releases is normally updated at about the same time as data files on logiqx.com and other things get updated sooner or later (most often later though, due to work and other interests). Today I have updated the Daphne, Kawaks and RAINE pages so all of the main emulators are now up to date. I also added ASTGL, DSP and Xor World pages because they've been waiting patiently for months! Lastly, I went through all of the emulator status information (active, dormant, etc) and also updated the recent/recommended/nonmame emulator lists a little.``xLogiqx``xlogiqx@logiqx.com``xBehind the Scenes``x1064087106,73591,``x``x
