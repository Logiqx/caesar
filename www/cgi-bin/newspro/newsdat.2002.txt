Now you get more of the benefit out of your 16-bit soundcard ;-)</li><br><li>Added log-to-.WAV feature</li><br><li>Fixed sample addressing glitch that caused some sounds not to play properly (notably the start of VF command #1 has thunder and "whoosh" sounds which were missing in 0.5.  This was first fixed in Modeler 0.9.3a).</li><br><li>Daytona US version set now uses the sample ROMs from the Japanese set (they're interchangable, and the ones in the original US set were bad). I realize it kinda sucks that you have to duplicate the samples in two zips now, but hey :)</li><br><li>Win32 version now uses a statically linked libz so no external DLL should be necessary.</li></ul>Known problems: (do not waste time on the boards asking about there)<br><ul><li>Star Wars Arcade doesn't have it's sound ROMs dumped so we are missing out on John Williams goodness.

You can use them to produce dats which contain the difference between one dat and another (i.e. emulator updates), but with the tiny mode, you only creat the needed roms, instead of recreating the whole games. This allows to create even smaller updates but still playable (as long as the emulator can use multiple rompaths).<br>As usual, Logiqx has a better explanation in this <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=retrogen&Number=52246&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post52246">forum post</a>, in his own page and in the MAMEDiff.txt.
