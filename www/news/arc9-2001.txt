This give you every available mode in the Screen Setup dialog when you change the depth or the scanlines. This also select for you the best video mode available keeping your options (scanlines, pixel double...) for every game you load.<br><br>* Fixed music tempo and sound effects in psykio games (gunbird, sengoku ace, and battle k road).<br><br>* Made the music acceleration in toaplan2 games optional (Set fast_tp2_sound to 0 in raine.cfg if you don't like it)<br><br>* Added a cache for solid sprite to get a 20-30% increase in speed for mazinger and most toaplan2 games (batrider...).<br><br>* Added speed hacks to every cave games : a little faster on slow machines, and animations smoother on fast machines !<br><br>* New palette update function for 8bpp modes for Windows 9x fullscreen modes, and linux fbcon.
