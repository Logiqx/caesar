Again I'd like to comment that this is my choice for CPS cheats, so if you use MAME, Kawaks, Nebula or Final Burn Alpha, go and try them.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

The last one, if you haven't read around, is the availability for emulators of the game Bang Bead, which is the sequel to the also NeoGeo game Battle Flipshot.<br><br>How to play the game? Well, Fandemame already included it in his <a href="http://fandemame.emu-france.com/">Fanbuild 0.59.5</a>. I want to mention also that you can find his page in <a href="http://fandemame.emu-france.com/">http://fandemame.emu-france.com</a> as he changed the host. I hope he delight us soon with his History.dat :)<br><br>And past friday was Andrew's birthday, the maintainer of GeoMAME and CPSMAME for Mac. While it was his birthday (happy belated bday Andrew!) the gift is for us, cause he released <a href="http://mac.emuhq.com/geomame/">GeoMAME 0.57d</a> which supports Bang Bead as well. In this release you will find support for the NeoPong latest revision, with sound.  </td></tr>  </table></p>
