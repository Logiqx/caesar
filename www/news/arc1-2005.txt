<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">logiqx</a> at at 11:12PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well, MAME v0.93 has got to have been the easiest update ever for me in regards data files and CAESAR! Nothing affected the supplementary data files and there weren't any game renames or ROM changes to affect the CAESAR groupings. Such an easy update only happens once every couple of years it seems! Anyway, that's a long way to say that CAESAR is up to date.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 12:48PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well, after breaking three fingers in the works, Aaron finally finished the sound system rewriting and this morning we got <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.93 "Seibu SPI decryption"</a>! Of course, the stars in the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> are Aaron's sound system rewrite and Nicola's decrypting graphics on Seibu SPI games, which includes some great Raiden shooters. There are various fixes all around too, and besides the SPI games, you can also play now Ufo Senshi Yohko Chan and hear sound in Tank8. And as Haze says, "please test this release extensively."  </td></tr>  </table></p>
