    <td>A huge update to MAME has been release earlier this day. If you haven't been following MAME progress last month, there is a new bug report system called Mantis which is far more useful than the old one.<br /><br />Aaron made some great job on cleaning up the source and also there were lots of new games added. Be sure to take a look at changelog to see if some work has been done on your favorite oldie, because many MAME developers had contributed their work to this release.<br /><br />Grab the latest binary (and source) at <a href="http://mamedev.org">mamedev.org</a>.<br /><br />Update: Haze wrote at MAMEWorld forums that 'the YM2203 is broken, which affects almost 500 games.'</td>
