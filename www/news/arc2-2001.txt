For those who are not native English speakers, <a href="http://www.emuhq.com/ml32/">MameLang 32+ beta 13 version C</a> has been released.<br>
<br>
This time, a new lang is finally added: Greek, after some time in the freezer, as promised Norwegian fully supported too, all .lng was updated due to some changes in the Lang dialog (all lang menu was removed, and back to the official Mame32 style, but with an improved Lang dialog, see it!)<br>
Version was reorganized, so the main versions are folders and beta ones are in sub-folders.  Also an internal change was made, preparing for customized categories, now if a game has no cat info and it's a clone, takes the info from the main game.  So, the cat info needed will be much lesser and the time reading the file will be smaller.<br>
Also Favorites bug was fixed AND Kaillera updated. .

As you might imagine, creating all my emulation tools and the CMPro/ROMCenter dats as well as maintaining CAESAR is pretty time consuming. I am therefore looking for people to help me complete the snapshots that need adding to CAESAR. It isn't actually a difficult job or too time consuming, it's just that little too much on top of everything else I do. If you would like to put something back into the community and say you are a part of CAESAR then please drop me an e-mail and I'll give you details of how to go about the task. I have prepared everything you need and even written a special tool that will check your snaps are named correctly, right format etc before you upload! Do you feel you would like to help? I really hope so. :)

A big <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip">WIP</a> update at the MAME page today, although no snaps so you can read it all here! 4th March 2001: Nicola Salmoria improved the C 68k core so that it can use separate memory handlers for different width data, and he fixed it from crashing in many Neo Geo games.

J&uuml;rgen Buchm&uuml;ller added some more functionality to the NEC uPD7810 CPU core. Olivier Galibert added linescroll support to the Konami K054157 emulation, used by Xexex, GI Joe and Asterix.
