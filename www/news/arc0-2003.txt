Influenced by Galaxy Force and other Sega's Growin Object games, Erik's first try in game creation reminds too much of Buck Rogers. It's still in development stages, agreeing with Erik about how easy the game is right now. But it has cool graphics, it has Duke, and a great soundtrack (trust me in that). It also saves best scores in the server, my name is in there already :) Erik wants feedback and ideas to enhance the game.
