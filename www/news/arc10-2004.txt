<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:08PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I totally overlooked two news bits from <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/" target=_blank>CPS2Shock</a>. First, there's a new XOR for SFX3 Japan. And second, Kawaks 1.50 has been released. It contains the new XORed game, quite a lot of new sets and clones, many rom renames and some bugfixes here and there.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>The Wizard of Rom</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 8:45AM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I don't do this kind of news now, but I thought I better mention <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/" target=_blank>ClrMamePro 3.50</a>. Why? Because it comes with the so-long-awaited and much-wanted-and-desired Set-Subfolder support. You can now specify subfolders for files inside sets, and ClrMamePro will happily reorganize them. This adds a whole new dimension to the usefulness of this already great rom-manager, so expect a lot of activity in the next months... Well, the last thing to mention is that it's a new feature which still needs testing, so be careful and report any oddities if you find any. Thanks Roman!  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 6:53PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Ohhhhhh, here it is <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.89 "Turbo Outrun"</a>, probably one of the most expected releases ever. It comes packed with all the good decryption and improvements of Sega System 16 games. Some games couldn't have been fixed in the U releases, but overall this version is Grade A+++. There are other novelties in the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> like discrete sound, more sampleset support, a Namco update and stuff, but all I wanna do right now is sing "Sega, Sega, oooooooooh Sega!"  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:39AM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> What a surprise, again a release so we have <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.42</a>! The big update is a brand new working CPS-2 driver. It supports almost 30 games, all parents (no clones) and pretty much with good graphic emulation. There are also a few bugs cleaned off Air Gallet and stuff, and a few oddities here and there. Boy am I specific...  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>When money is not important anymore...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:24PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Tux has released <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.41.3</a>, which fixes an important bug which gave many problems in a bunch of games. Please update and stuff. Oh and look at these great <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=&Number=12484&page=0&view=expanded&sb=5&o=&fpart=1&vc=1" target=_blank>MAME tokens</a>. They look absolutely gorgeous. I don't have a cab or anything, and the ordering is for big quantities... So if after buying thse,  any of you want to send me a couple of tokens, I'd be eternally grateful! If these were in Amazon, I'd open a wishlist...  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Thanks Giles it's Friday</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:14AM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> For the powerphone owners, here it is <a href="http://www.harmonicode.com/EMame/" target=_blank>EMame 1.0</a> for Series 60 and Motorola A925. My Alcatel can't even have a logo, so I don't care much, but I'm sure many of you will like.<br><br>Derrick Renaud has prepared a good <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=162233&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post162233" target=_blank>Discrete Component documentation</a>. It's still unfinished, and it's changing as the discrete components change too. Let's hope this will help other developers into discrete simulation so if Mr. Renaud goes on holiday, we're not left hanging with nothing on the horizon...<br><br>And Tux has released <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.41.2 aka "London meeting"</a>. On the emulation side, there's nothing big new, but there are quite some good bug fixes. A remarkable thing is an early WIP CPS-2 driver... On the "London meeting" side, hope you all attending the meet have a good time and everything. Cheers!  </td></tr>  </table></p>
