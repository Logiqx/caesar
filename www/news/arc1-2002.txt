You've read right, they focused on improving current emulation instead of adding lots of buggy drivers :)<br>You can go to your usual <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/">RAINE Official site</a> and get it, while you do it, you can either read the <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/rainedoc/node67.html">long changelog</a> or read my condensed version with the most important things:<ul><li>Updated docs! Woohoo! Zaxxon1 and Liliana helped with them, plus Liliana made a new background for the GUI.</li><li>Stephane Humbert (Stephh) updated the cheats for RAINE, plus fixing lots of DSW in the toaplan2 driver and locating bugs in it as well.</li><li>Logiqx made some dozens of ROM changes, making RAINE a lot more compatible with the MAME sets, it will make easier to maintain RAINE roms :) And he also detected some bad dumps so the new sets will improve some games a lot.</li><li>An incredible amount of sound fixes, including Q-Sound for CPS-1 games. A good amount of emulation fixes as well, this release is greatly improved in that part.</li><li>A lot of other fixes related to the GUI and general emulation. </li></ul>So you're going to play the same RAINE games, but certainly you will play them better! In my opinion, a high quality release :)  </td></tr>  </table></p>

To name a few, Captain America, Lemmings (prototype), Alpha One (Major Havoc prototype),and I guess some more not listed on the whatsnew.txt file.
