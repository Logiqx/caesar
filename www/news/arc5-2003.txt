Here it has been worse, somehow the news went wrong and we lost everything. Our last backup comes from mid march, so we have lost a lot. We are trying to see if we can solve it, anyway we will place all the past news (the ones we have) when we can :(<br><br>GBMan has released <a href="http://www.lanzadera.com/esmame32/" target=_blank>EsMAME 0.69u3</a>. Poor man always updates the same day (or the day before) Haze does another release. Well then I'd say: GBMan, keep them coming!<br><br>Congratulations to Till because <a href="http://www.sys2064.com/" target=_blank>SYS2064</a> reached four million visitors very recently. One day we will reach four millions too, when MAME 1.0 is released or so...  </td></tr>  </table></p>
