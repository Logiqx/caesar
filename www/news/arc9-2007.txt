    <td>Only three days ago there was an update and now there is a full version. The most interesting part is a new 64-bit version for those who have a modern PC. Most games run as in 32-bit version, but some other run about 10-15% faster, so you might want to try it.<br /><br />Also be sure to update your Neo-Geo roms, because they changed a lot.</td>
