  <tr><th><strong>Nothing else interesting has happened lately...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 11:21PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Today, <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.90 "Sega Madness"</a> is available! This might be one of the best official releases of MAME, due to the great contents of the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a>. As the name suggest, this includes a lot of Sega improvements and fixes with stuff from System 16 to Model 3 (and the evil ST-V). Not only that, there has been a great revamping in the old Bubble Bobble driver, which is driving all the fans crazy of pleasure. ElSemi also submitted a quite working Crystal System driver, Derrick Renaud has added even more discrete sound components and functionality, and in short, there are lots of new stuff for everyone. So, there's only one thing left to do: enjoy!<br><br>On another technical shores, Bryan McPhail's <a href="http://www.vcmame.net/pcbtm/index.html" target=_blank>PCB Target Manager</a> has arrived. I'll try to explain it, if I got it right: it's an universal device to interface arcade pcb's to PC's, allowing trojaning and analisys of protection gadgets or encrypted CPU's. Pretty much as Charles McDonald's method of reading the protected CPU's, but geared towards any kind of chip. It uses a combination of custom hardware to link the pcb's and software to drive the tests. It will also allow programmers to test unknown functions in the target CPU's, analyze the meaning of obscure registers, and in general it seems to be a really great tool for emulation developers out there. Bryan says that hardware schematics and software will be available soon.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

Of course, he has also updated <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/easyemu/" target=_blank>EasyEmu</a> after some months of pause. Eight guides have been updated and six new ones have been added.

  <tr><th><strong>The shortest day of the year is near</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 11:03PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well, you know the news in this site are not much news, rather oldies ^_^ Still, I will keep making the odd post from time to time, who knows if I will ever go back at posting news more often, or at least make interesting posts... Doubtful. However, there are a couple things I noticed today. First one is an update by Randy about <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=164894&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post164894" target=_blank>The Dumping Project</a>, with the usual good and bad stuff, and promises for the future. Also there's another update of <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>The Lord Of All Known And Paralell Unieverses' Home Page</a>, and happy belated birthday to you too.<br><br>And finally, my deepest apologies to Dan, because I totally overlooked and forgot to post about his nice site dedicated to <a href="http://www.cooganphoto.com/gravitar" target=_blank>Gravitar</a>, a great classic by Atari which is in its early twenties. The site has captures, information, hints and tips, and well, deals with this colorful vector arcade which I happen to like as well (although I'm clumsy when playing it). I hope he'll beep me when he makes another try for the world record. Anyway, he also forgot to include CAESAR in his links page... ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>
