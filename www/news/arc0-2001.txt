Mike has posted the news that he has a Sega System E board and will draw up a schematic for it while he's away this week. Once that's done he should have enough information to finish the System E driver in <a href="http://mimic.arcadeheaven.com">Mimic</a> and who knows, maybe a release will be imminent!

Seems that the guys at <a href="http://cps2shock.retrogames.com/wip.html">CPS2Shock</a> are progressing well with their decryption of SFZ. They have decrypted one of the code ROMs and just need to add the unencrypted data back in. Another thing they've done is get the changer version of SFZ running on CPS2 (albeit without sound and sprites) so it proves how similar the CPS1 and CPS2 hardware are.
