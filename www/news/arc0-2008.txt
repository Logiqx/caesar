    <td>Remember DiscreteSIM? Now there is new Pong emulator called DICE (Discrete Integrated Circuit Emulator)! It's an early build, so there may be some bugs in it as Adam B., author of the emu writes in his <a href="http://adamulation.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. Also it's faster than DiscreteSIM (20-25 FPS on 2.2 GHz Athlon XP), so it might be possible to play at 100% speed with 3-4 GHz PC.<br /><br />Also author hopes to add other games in the future, so stay tuned.</td>
