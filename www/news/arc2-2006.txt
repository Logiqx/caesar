  <tr><th><strong>St. Patrick's Edition</strong><br/>

The main change in this new version is the addition of Sega Master System, with support for online high scores in seven of them. Enjoy!  </td></tr>  </table></p>

It means that the one and only current dealer of legal ROMs for selling is stopping activities after more than 2 years. I hope others continue where they left, and I wish good luck in any endeavour to the brave business men who founded StarROMs.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Legal ROMs</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 6:14PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> There's an arcade game which has been released as free (and for non-commercial usage) at <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.org</a>. As Aaron explains, the author of <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/roms/alienar/" target=_blank>Alien Arena</a> has decided to release this creation which was essentially homebrew in its nature. But homebrew arcade games weren't so common back in 1984! Maybe not the best game ever, but a little piece of arcade history and a completely legal ROM to download and enjoy.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>The late night Douglas Adams' show</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 4:33PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Erik has released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 2.3</a>. This new version has the ability to be played as an applet, if you want. The other improvements are MSX related, with a few more games and better MSX-2 support (that's deluxe, you know).  </td></tr>  </table></p>
