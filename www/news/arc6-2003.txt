The chap is getting old, don't hammer him too much about that fact. Thankfully he left the frontpage deals of this site to the younger generations ^_^ A bit of bio about this guy: not only he appears in the <a href="http://emu-celebs.consollection.com/index.php?rub=8&idPerso=30" target=_blank>leetest places</a>, he also doubles in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=logiqx&btnG=Google+Search" target=_blank>Google hits</a> comparing him with giants as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&q=nicola+salmoria" target=_blank>Mr. Nicola Salmoria</a>, for example. Ok, in this post I gave you a small clue for today's game: in which freaky way Logiqx is related to Jack Nicholson in the movie <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0081505" target=_blank>The Shining</a>?

This one has been tested in Windows 2000 and for the only feedback I've seen, it works well. Allows you to set how long each game is shown before changing to another one, and has some other features.
