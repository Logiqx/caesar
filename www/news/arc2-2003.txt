So the torture will end soon. <i>All this is a joke, I'm really impressed with the 3Dfx emulation and all *drool*</i>  </td></tr>  </table></p>

The anniversary will be on March 19th, and the logo will be changed on April's Fool. Apparently it's not a joke. You can read in that press note some funny blurb justifying the design, something I always found really funny. Thanks to SmoothDancer for the link.  </td></tr>  </table></p>
