  <tr><th><strong>Happy New Year</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 7:02AM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Althought I was a bit sick, I had a great entrance to year 2004! I hope you're having / you've had a good one too! Specially to Logiqx who went to bed early, and he's still waiting patiently that I make my comeback. Don't wait too much, give me 10 days more to recover and I'm here! I didn't want it to be sooooo long pause, but well... Send me support emails so I make the comeback this month! Happy New Year to every everyone!  </td></tr>  </table></p>
