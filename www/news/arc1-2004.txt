It's an one time offer special spin-off RomBuild, it takes a good MAME 0.79 set and generates the needed roms for 26 changed Neo-Geo dumps for MAME 0.80 (when it gets released) or 0.79u4, and for Kawaks 1.49. It takes about 30 seconds, or 90 in my ghetto PC. This tool doesn't have a page, doesn't have any kind of support, no updates ever... It wasn't even gonna be created ^_^ But it's easy and fast, and creates some more roms than ClrMamePro's deep analysis or other fixers around. So give it a try and save yourself time and 300mb downloads.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

It makes some games unplayable. I suggest you to get the new ClrMamePro and get rid of them ASAP, and better now than later, emergency action recommended. The only exception might be the psarc95 set, <a href="http://www.clrmame.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=clrmame&Number=562&page=1&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post562" target=_blank>follow the instructions</a>, but I think no game of that bios works anyway ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>
