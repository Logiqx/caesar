  <tr><th><strong>Where's my news?</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 1:49PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I'm sorry for being late about announcing <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target=_blank>MAME 0.106 "Fighter's History"</a>, which was released this saturday. I've been a bit on/off due to some massive hangover ^_^ Anyway, get the official Windows binaries at <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a>. The <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0106.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a> isn't really exciting from my point of view, although there are a few remarkable, or at least, curious things. Like the JED files for PLD/PAL chips, and the new text for games not working... But come on, a MAME release physically smaller to the previous? Ah, that's progress... <br><br>And while you're at it, get your updated cheat.dat at <a href="http://cheat.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Pugsy's MAME Cheat Page</a>. Two updates in a row, go Pugsy!  </td></tr>  </table></p>
