This allows me to code specific functionality into current and future releases based on this Device ID and the manufacturer of the device. Previously I used basic ifdef statements based on the CPU, which is no longer a valid way to id the device since they will all be ARM :) <br><br>- Implemented the iPaq 3800 display workaround. The iPaq 3800 has a bug which causes GAPI screen access to be delayed (creating a severe display redraw penalty). By implementing this in conjunction with my Unique ID I can use or not use the GAPI functions in the same code.<br><br>- Tinkered with the sound routines. Still no major improvement. <br><br>- Improved Graphics routines. Display redraws should be a fraction faster. <br><br>- Preliminary evaluation of support for the Grayscale devices. <br><br>- Fixed gx.dll install on PocketPC 2002. Cab files now install properly even if you answer No to installing the gx.dll (previously it would fail to install at all).  </td></tr>  </table></p>
