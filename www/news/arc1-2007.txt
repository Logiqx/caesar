Belmont released <a href="http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?p=182" target=_blank>M1 0.7.7u2</a> yesterday. As I said, I'm in a hurry so I can't check the changelog right now.

  <tr><th><strong>Anniversary Edition, twice</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 7:17PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> First of all, happy birthday, MAME. Ten years of one of the coolest projects ever, isn't it nice? And as the tradition dictates, <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank">MAME 0.112</a> was released, and binaries should be available there and in <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>mame.net</a> in a bit. Scouting in the <a href="http://mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0112.txt" target=_blank>changelog</a>, we see a big list of contributors. Thanks to them all! There's not much noteworthy (and I'm in a hurry right now), but HSF is included. OMG, it's the end of the sk3n3!  </td></tr>  </table></p>
