    <td>Better late than never.<br /><br />Yesterday ElSemi released an update to Model 2 emulator. It includes some great fixes to Daytona USA, one new game (Wave Runner) and many fixes to graphics such as switching to vertex and pixel shaders. Also network support is added (no play over Internet, but fine on LAN).<br /><br />Be sure to try this <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">emulator</a>, if you haven't before.</td>
