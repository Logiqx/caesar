They're playable and amazingly, two thirds of the new games have sound. Soon more games will have internet score too. I just hope he doesn't slip in and add cheats too ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:32PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> A few interesting things happening lately. If you're in much need of zero-minute arcade news, visit <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>MameWorld</a>, its News Submission board, or any general emu board...<br><br>First, an old favorite of mine with a new release: <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/" target=_blank>ScummVM 0.6.1</a>. The main stuff on this release is the amount of bugs fixed and a few functionalities added. Thanks to RetroK for the news.<br><br>Erik Duijs is still developing <a href="http://movegaga.nl/80s/" target=_blank>JEmu2</a>. A few bugs have been sorted out, but it still plays the same five classics. Not that it was bad, but I was expecting a couple of new supported gems. Java, OpenGL, blah blah blah. Must try it! And then, "clap your hands".<br><br>And finally a new release/rewrite of ElSemi's infamous beast, <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula Model 2 v0.1 alpha</a>. This rewrite needs Direct-X 9, but uses a lighter (faster?) framework. And has good words from a few knowledgeable guys. Thanks to Tourniquet for the prompt news.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

It celebrates Norbert's birthday (happy one, Norbert!) and it's an exact port of this old 3d vector classic. The game is playable online, or downloadable with source. Read the front page because the details of how this was achieved are quite interesting. Thanks to Stiletto.<br><br><a href="http://www.widel.com/" target=_blank>David Widel</a> has finally released the source for the 96in1 Pacman driver. Petr1fied has also made <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=&Number=161&page=0&view=expanded&sb=5&o=&fpart=1" target=_blank>diff and make file</a> to easily make a tiny compile for this game.

  <tr><th><strong>Another bi-weekly lengthy post</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 2:37PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well I'm going to try to make up for the last days without any post with the most interesting stuff happening lately. First of all, visit <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/" target=_blank>Logiqx.com</a> where his tools are still evolving into amazing utilities. I am stuck about MAME and arcade emulation because I don't have enough space to update anything until I buy a new burner... And honestly I'm quite down and lack of motivation and blah blah blah... Ya know.<br><br>Mr. Widel has made a <a href="http://d_widel.tripod.com/main.htm" target=_blank>96 in 1 Pacman driver for MAME</a>. It's a multiple game and I don't know if it's going to be added to official MAME. Check it out because it's there for a limited time, the download is almost 5mb and contains... Thanks to Dalthon for the news.<br><br>A few days ago Ad_Enuff posted about <a href="http://www.wayoftherodent.com/pa/pa_staff.htm" target=_blank>Paper Arcade</a>. If you have been paying attention lately, you know what it is. If not, check it out. Actually this new page pointed out has new things (for changing micro-money) and has a compilation of both parts of Paper Arcade. Enjoy folding.<br><br>And Erik Duijs, famous for his Java emulation projects, recovered the old CottAGE and revamped it up to today's standards. You can check the <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=retroemuprog&Number=3712&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=7#Post3712" target=_blank>testing thread</a> for a few beta versions with Java Web Start and OpenGL support. It didn't work here, but well it's beta and he needs testing. Good to see him around and active.<br><br>Today's <a href="http://www.comics.com/comics/offthemark/index.html" target=_blank>Off The Mark</a> comic strip features a strange arcade game that my cat also wants to play...

  <tr><th><strong>One post to make it for all this time.</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 2:14PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> First of all, happy birthday to Logiqx, he's now something like 64 years old or very close. And second, sorry for the news draught but I really wasn't up to the task. Still, let me mention a few things which might have been overlooked by other sites:<br><br>About emus: <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE</a> has been updated a couple of times. Better check and update. <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/pc2jamma/" target=_blank>Vantage 1.12</a> has also been updated after years of being dormant. Peale and the rest have added a few drivers and things. Someone released <a href="http://rcpboards.proboards20.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&num=1087382432" target=_blank>U64Emu 3.40 tnl edition</a>. I think it's not official, but I haven't heard anything bad. It fixed quite a lot of things from previous versions.<br><br>Someone (sorry I forgot who!) found a PDF for <a href="http://people.ac.upc.es/vmoya/docs/emuprog.pdf" target=_blank>Programming Emulators</a>. It's in english and it seems it's quite good, although I haven't checked myself, so it might be something old already published.<br><br><a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/" target=_blank>Guru</a> has opened a Naomi dumping list. <a href="http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/" target=_blank>Charles McDonald</a> has updated his site with even more information. <a href="http://www.system16.com/" target=_blank>System 16 - The Arcade Museum</a> was updated heavily, you better visit. <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games</a> was updated too I think, you should never miss this resource. And <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/maws/" target=_blank>M.A.W.S.</a> was updated like 150 times.<br><br>A special mention about <a href="http://www.ascotti.org/programming/tickle/tickle.htm" target=_blank>Tickle 0.92</a>, Alessandro sent this to me two weeks ago... Well the little emulator has more analog sounds, Frogger and Galaxian, and more things. Worth getting and trying.<br><br><a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.84</a> wasn't overlooked by other sites, so I won't mention <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>what's new</a>.<br><br>And if you liked Paper Arcade, here you have the <a href="http://www.wayoftherodent.com/pa/bs_pa_wave2.htm" target=_blank></a><br><a href="" target=_blank>Second Wave</a>.
