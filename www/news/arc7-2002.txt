The team has noted that this is somewhat a "beta", and a full release (3.0?) will come soon. Binary and sources available.<br><b>Update:</b> Jan has just uploaded a very small update which makes FBA run even faster on slower PC's. A bless for blokes like me with prehistoric junk.

  <tr><th><strong>Gas Music from my home</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:14PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I wonder if someone was able to run <a href="http://www.jmargolin.com/">Gas Music from Jupiter</a>. In this W2k, nothing is heard. I checked the volumes for midi and synthetizer channels of my two soundcards and nothing... It annoys me that there's no play button or something so I'm not even sure if I'm "using" it properly. Any clue?  </td></tr>  </table></p>

So I thought I could post a <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/team/pi/pi_big.png">pic of myself</a> for my female fans (if any). Please note that I've not smoked in seven months, I'm single and hetero.
