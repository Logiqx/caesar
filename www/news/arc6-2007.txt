    <td>ElSemi released final version of his <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/">CPS-3 Emulator</a>. It emulates transparencies (sort of, not the actual thing) and CHDs. If anyone is still curious about the differences between CHD and no CHD games &mdash; there are none. Only the loading time. CHDs take much more time to boot.<br /><br />Andreas made a post with CPS-3 keys on June 9. It took a month to emulate everything.</td>
