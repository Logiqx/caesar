For the ones who sent gross emails, go to <a href="http://www.hell.com/">here</a>. To the one about the necrophilia, <a href="http://www.fuckyou.org/">this</a>. But mainly thanks to the rest! Also kudos to the other news posters who featured me in such nice sites :)<br>Besides that, it has been one month since I've stopped smoking. My target is closer everyday. It's possible, so you could also try. Soon my board sig will change to reflect it :)<br>I was going to mention that I almost didn't come today, that probably tomorrow I will not be here, that we want another news poster... But ZERO is the number of people who contacted me about that. So, again, read yesterday's last post again, and think about it... We want your help!<br>And to finish, Morrigan is much more cute, smart, fast, powerful, sexy, gorgeous and also has more you-know-what than Lilith. Just that Lilith has a couple of funny moves.   </td></tr>  </table></p>

The problem is, I don't remember who is the maintainer of that page, nor the name of the page. Plus, I don't know the name of that game and I don't know any far east language (I suposse) to even read the title. I think it will be for MAME but that's again only my guess. Nonetheless the game looks good and it reminds me of a similar game...<br>Not bad for a news poster, this really shows my knowledge :)  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>M1 0.6</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">rob</a> at at 11:17PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Version 0.6 of this Model 1 and 2A sound emulator has been released. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.impactemu.com/index.phtml?s=news">Impact</a>.<br><br>Changes from 0.5:<br><ul><li>Added Japanese Daytona set, corrected badly dumped US set using its ROMs</li><br><li>Added WingWar R360 version</li><br><li>Added minimal user interface to both Linux and Win32: ESC now exits cleanly (useful for those of you still running DOS-based Windows like 98 and ME) and + and - keys to navigate the tunes for each game.</li><br><li>Overall volume boosted substantially.  Now you get more of the benefit out of your 16-bit soundcard ;-)</li><br><li>Added log-to-.WAV feature</li><br><li>Fixed sample addressing glitch that caused some sounds not to play properly (notably the start of VF command #1 has thunder and "whoosh" sounds which were missing in 0.5.  This was first fixed in Modeler 0.9.3a).</li><br><li>Daytona US version set now uses the sample ROMs from the Japanese set (they're interchangable, and the ones in the original US set were bad). I realize it kinda sucks that you have to duplicate the samples in two zips now, but hey :)</li><br><li>Win32 version now uses a statically linked libz so no external DLL should be necessary.</li></ul>Known problems: (do not waste time on the boards asking about there)<br><ul><li>Star Wars Arcade doesn't have it's sound ROMs dumped so we are missing out on John Williams goodness.  Please somebody rectify this problem.</li><br><li>Sample banking isn't 100%, so some songs may sound weird.</li><br><li>Model 2B/2C and Model 3 games with only 1 or 2 SCSPs are in the pipeline, but the emulation doesn't yet sound good enough to release. Please be patient :-)</li></ul>  </td></tr>  </table></p>
