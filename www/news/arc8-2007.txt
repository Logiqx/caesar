    <td>Finally it's here. There were several regressions along the way, but Aaron fixed most of them in v0.118u6, so there shouldn't be any problems with this release.<br /><br />In the other news, some new clones added and decryption keys for the last dumped CPS-2 games are found by Nicola Salmoria and David Haywood.</td>

    <td>A little bit late to inform anyone interested, but still it's better late than never. ElSemi has released CPX3 (CPS 3 emulator for Xbox), so now Xbox owners (not Xbox 360, but the original one) can play CPS3 games too.<br /><br />No links provided since it's made with XDK, but you'll be able to find the emulator mostly everywhere.</td>
