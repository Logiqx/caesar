As the name suggest, the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> contains quite some Sega and Arcadia improvements, along with fix ups in Kaneko, the debugger and (drum roll) Lethal Enforcers just to name a few. Oh, and <a href="http://haze.mameworld.info/" target=_blank>MAME 0.91u1</a> is already out, which fixes mainly a bug in the memory system. Note that 0.91u1 has Gauntlet Legends.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 12:43PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well, this is interesting stuff since he has never been too publically available; it seems that <a href="http://mame.blogdrive.com/" target=_blank>Nicola Salmoria has opened a web blog</a>. There's already some MAME development explained by the very founder and creator of MAME. Great.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>FBA Neo-Geo update!</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">logiqx</a> at at 2:06PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I have updated the FBA page to include all of the latest game information. One of the biggest changes that I noticed (in addition to a few dozen new games) was the move to the modern MAME Neo-Geo sets. If I remember correctly, this was the last major emulator that needed to make the change (Nebula and Kawaks had already done so). I have also updated the Pacifi3D page for v0.2 which was released earlier this week.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

There are a few new nice things, like a DX9 blitter, a new 68k core and a driver for 68EC020 based Psikyo hardware (which is great, imho).  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 12:56PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I just saw that there's some <a href="http://pacifi3d.retrogames.com/" target=_blank>Pacifi3D WIP</a> with chase and classic views. I really thought the only thing this emu needed was the chase camera, it would make it more playable, so I'm already awaiting the next version. Also I saw in the horizon the release of <a href="http://www.cps2shock.com/" target=_blank>Kawaks 1.53</a>, with support for more hacks, some fixes, and a no rotation option. You know, Kawaks is still my choice for NeoGeo and CPS emulation, what can I do...  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:14PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Foster, the author of NeoCD/SDL, has released <a href="http://www.geocities.com/neocdsdl/pacifi3d.html" target=_blank>Pacifi3D 0.1</a>. That page is hosted at Geo-lowbandwidth-Cities, so Mr. Do has gently set up a <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mrdo/pacifi3d.html" target=_blank>mirror</a>. I was gonna make another, but he was first. In short, this is a PacMan emulator, using the original roms, but substituting the usual sprites with 3D objects using polygons. The result is quite cute, and he has some improvements on the way. Try it!  </td></tr>  </table></p>

The updates are scarce like whales, but big like... Whales.<br><br>Gerard has also been busy at <a href="http://www.arcadeflyers.com/" target=_blank>The Arcade Flyers Archive</a>, where a new Flyerpack for MAME has been released. This is brand new, so toss away the old ones and use these new flyers instead. More than 2,500 flyers included.<br><br>And a brief mention for <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games</a>, updated again, and removing some really old Sega entries.

  <tr><th><strong>Nothing else interesting has happened lately...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:21PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Today, <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.90 "Sega Madness"</a> is available! This might be one of the best official releases of MAME, due to the great contents of the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a>. As the name suggest, this includes a lot of Sega improvements and fixes with stuff from System 16 to Model 3 (and the evil ST-V). Not only that, there has been a great revamping in the old Bubble Bobble driver, which is driving all the fans crazy of pleasure. ElSemi also submitted a quite working Crystal System driver, Derrick Renaud has added even more discrete sound components and functionality, and in short, there are lots of new stuff for everyone. So, there's only one thing left to do: enjoy!<br><br>On another technical shores, Bryan McPhail's <a href="http://www.vcmame.net/pcbtm/index.html" target=_blank>PCB Target Manager</a> has arrived. I'll try to explain it, if I got it right: it's an universal device to interface arcade pcb's to PC's, allowing trojaning and analisys of protection gadgets or encrypted CPU's. Pretty much as Charles McDonald's method of reading the protected CPU's, but geared towards any kind of chip. It uses a combination of custom hardware to link the pcb's and software to drive the tests. It will also allow programmers to test unknown functions in the target CPU's, analyze the meaning of obscure registers, and in general it seems to be a really great tool for emulation developers out there. Bryan says that hardware schematics and software will be available soon.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>A few updates...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">logiqx</a> at at 9:33PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I have added a few of the new emulators to CAESAR and even done snapshots for them; Crystal System Emulator, Radikal Bikers Emulator and Tickle. I have also updated the pages for Kawaks, RAINE and ZiNc so the Recent Emus page is matching the <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/Dats/Dats.shtml">dats</a> page at Logiqx.com exactly now! Kawaks has been updated again today (Kawaks v1.51) but I haven't done the updates for Logiqx.com or CAESAR yet.  </td></tr>  </table></p>
