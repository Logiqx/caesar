<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:58PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> ElSemi has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Crystal System emulator v1.2</a>. According to his statements, a few bugs have been sorted out and this means no known bugs in the emulation are left. <br><br>Another news bit is that MrV2K has brougth <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=&Number=17382&page=0&view=expanded&sb=5&o=&fpart=1&vc=1" target=_blank>EasyEmu is back to life</a>. He's asking about what need to be covered or expanded in the current #1 emulation tutorial site. Which is approaching one million visitors quickly! Of course, he has also updated <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/easyemu/" target=_blank>EasyEmu</a> after some months of pause. Eight guides have been updated and six new ones have been added. Don't forget to recommend this site to newbies!  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Not bad, coming from Santa...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 5:03PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> ElSemi (dressed as Santa) did his work on xmas morning, and <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com" target=_blank>Crystal Systems Emulator</a> has been released. Crystal Systems is an arcade hardware similar to PGM. The emulator supports two games: Crystal of the Kings and Evolution Soccer. I really don't know much more about this emulator, just that ShengLuc mentioned it on RG/Gen, so thanks to him.<br>  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>The shortest day of the year is near</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:03PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well, you know the news in this site are not much news, rather oldies ^_^ Still, I will keep making the odd post from time to time, who knows if I will ever go back at posting news more often, or at least make interesting posts... Doubtful. However, there are a couple things I noticed today. First one is an update by Randy about <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=164894&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post164894" target=_blank>The Dumping Project</a>, with the usual good and bad stuff, and promises for the future. Also there's another update of <a href="http://www.aarongiles.com/" target=_blank>The Lord Of All Known And Paralell Unieverses' Home Page</a>, and happy belated birthday to you too.<br><br>And finally, my deepest apologies to Dan, because I totally overlooked and forgot to post about his nice site dedicated to <a href="http://www.cooganphoto.com/gravitar" target=_blank>Gravitar</a>, a great classic by Atari which is in its early twenties. The site has captures, information, hints and tips, and well, deals with this colorful vector arcade which I happen to like as well (although I'm clumsy when playing it). I hope he'll beep me when he makes another try for the world record. Anyway, he also forgot to include CAESAR in his links page... ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>
