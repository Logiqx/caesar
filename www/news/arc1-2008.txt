Also some optimizations were made to the emulator, so Pong runs 30% than before. Full screen and mouse support included.<br /><br /><a href="http://adamulation.blogspot.com/">Be sure to try it</a>.</td>

    <td>It took eight intermediate releases to get to this version. During January more than 100 bugs were fixed in MAME source (thanks to Aaron Giles for his generous proposal to donate money to MAME Dumping Project for every fixed bug and all those people who did the fixing).<br /><br />You should definitely try this version, because today is MAME's eleventh anniversary. Get your copy at <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAMEDev</a> and be sure to say your 'thank you' to the MAME Team and all those numerous contributors who have helped to develop project over all those years.</td>
