    <td>This one is a week earlier than might be expected. There are major changes in core and virtually no new games added. There is even minimalistic menu, so it would be easier for new users to start using MAME and stop asking questions why MAME is a DOS program.<br /><br />Go straight to <a href="http://mamedev.org">MAMEDev</a> and start testing.</td>
