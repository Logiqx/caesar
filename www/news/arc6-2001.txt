  <tr><th><strong>News Poster Required!</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">logiqx</a> at at 11:14AM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> I am looking for one or two people that can assist me in posting arcade related news items for CAESAR. It would be nice if I can take a break occasionally and have people keep an eye out for emulator releases whilst I'm away (obviously important I don't miss anything for CAESAR's sake). If you think you could help me out then please drop me an e-mail and I'll explain the methods for monitoring web pages etc. I start a new job soon so my spare time will be greatly reduced and I will also be looking to get a couple of helpers together for the dat maintenance too (hence the FAQ I wrote about them). If you have read the FAQ at my main site and understand it completely then I would also like to hear from you.  </td></tr>  </table></p>
