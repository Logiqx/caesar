<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 1:35PM [GMT]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> After some time not paying attention to anything in the cold kilt emu sk3n3, I've noticed the release of <a href="http://www.smallnews.net/azuco/" target=_blank>Hornet 060131</a>. This is supposedly a Konami Hornet emulator (see the <a href="http://www.system16.com/konami/hrdw_hornet.html" target=_blank>System 16 page</a> devoted to this system). But according to the experiences of some people, it still doesn't do anything. <br><br>And Erik released <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 2.1</a>, with many fixes specially in the MSX part.<br><br>Now back to my hibernation. See you in spring ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>
