    <td>New MAME release happened earlier today. Many changes to the source by Aaron and new MAME in MAME game added.<br /><br />By the way, one of the most popular MAME derivatives - MAME32 - changed its name to MameUI because there is now an official 64-bit version too. If you have a modern PC you'll notice that some of the 3D games are running at really good speed.</td>
