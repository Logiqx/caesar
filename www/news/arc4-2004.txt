<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:04PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.40.2</a> has been released. Although it's not as big or <i>accurate</i> as the Borg, it's one of my favorite emulators and I still use it to play certain games in my ghettoputer(tm). There are lots of fixes, updated hiscore.dat, and a bunch of new games like Caliber 50, Daioh and Zombie Raid. Unfortunately, no new games not in MAME. And also unfortunately, there's a lot of code needing rewriting, so it will pass a long time until a new version comes out, if it ever comes...  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:38PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> The last news I've received are from Alessandro Scotti (sorry for the delay). He has released <a href="http://www.ascotti.org/programming/tickle/tickle.htm" target=_blank>Tickle 0.91</a>. Tickle is a framework for developing emulators, but as well supports many arcade games and some nice features. It has about 20 games, and the latest version includes a new frontend for the Linux port, experimental force feedback (with Space Invaders!) and fixes everywhere. Try it!  </td></tr>  </table></p>

As you can guess, lately I'm having a big problem with motivation, or better said, the lack of it. I am not doing news as I did before, so basically I'm an echo of the <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=news" target=_blank>News Submission board</a>, just with better quality english. And nowadays it's true (never so true as before) that most of the news are MAME related, and for that <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>MameWorld</a> is doing a great job. No, don't worry, for now I'll make the odd post about things non MAME, since I'm aware that many projects don't have the public light they deserve. So if you have something you feel should be here, go on and tell me by email, in the News board or by PM in the MameWorld forums.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

Trying to rest from the heavier work, he has got SFR: The Rock running (which I can't see how it can be a lighter task) and suffers from the same problem as the first SFR which prevents the games to run properly. The good thing is that he has found the problem and he is solving it already, so even if there's no computer to run them, they'll get preserved. <br><br>I also saw some other interesting things about WIP related to MAME and emulation. Check for example this thread about <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=145104&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post145104" target=_blank>brute force attack to ZN's encryption keys</a>. After some devs commenting about it, it seems much more than feasible and I'd say we'll see results very soon. Also take a look at this other message by RB about <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=&Number=52184&page=0&view=expanded&sb=5&o=&fpart=1" target=_blank>CPU cores</a> but it's too cryptic to really get some real info.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

The site has videos and stuff, and it's interesting. If you're nuts you can also try making something similar in your city ;) Thanks to Italie for the link.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Talking about the MAME</strong><br/>

The article is quite wrong and it doesn't even deal with the official MAME, but with MAME32 Plus! which is one of the popular unofficial builds. Thanks to Mr. Do for this link.<br><br>As a response, Almightyjustin scanned and uploaded for everyone this <a href="http://www.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamegeneral&Number=144459&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post144459" target=_blank>Gamepro article</a> also about MAME. Althought this article is much older, it's more exact and reflects better the MAME spirit, IMHO.  </td></tr>  </table></p>
