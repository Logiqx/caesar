As usual, the text of the update also contains juicy tidbits you shouldn't miss ;) And this time he focused more on providing accurate information than in increasing it. There are twenty new games, but he has updated and removed many more games, with correct names and information. The truth is out there! And now, also in Emustatus :)  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Grand opening today - bring the kids</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 12:47PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Gazoo has opened today <a href="http://trc.retrogames.com/">The Review Center</a>, the sucessor of his old NRC, but now more generic - and more big. Of course I like reviews and I like green so let's use the fireworks and let's command the orchestra to play at full volume! For now he has only added NeoGeo games, and the site is ready for you to sign up and all that (btw nice design dude). Let's do some reviews! Thanks to Gazoo himself for his kind letter :)  </td></tr>  </table></p>
