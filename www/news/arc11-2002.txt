It's interesting to see his view about <a href="http://www.samspade.org/d/persfire.html" target=_blank>personal firewalls</a>, he has an <a href="http://www.samspade.org/d/firewalls.html" target=_blank>in-deep discussion about them</a>, and provides a link to a <a href="http://cyberpunks.org/display/356/article/" target=_blank>very interesting article</a>. I don't know how much of all this is true, but makes me look the whole thing under a new perspective. I'll do some more research and if things keep looking the same, I'll uninstall my snake oil.<br><br>On the other hand, I had some nice advice from Logiqx about <a href="http://www.argosoft.com/" target=_blank>ArGoSoft Mail Server</a>, a freeware POP3/SMTP server which I use now for outbounding emails from my addy.
