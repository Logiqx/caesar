I guess these have the same quality as the others, nowhere to be found yet, but one expects them to be uploaded to the newsgroups and eventually to <a href="http://www.mamehot.net/" target=_blank>MameHot</a>.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>More stuff about the resurrection</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:47AM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Peale gave me the page they have for <a href="http://vantage.jbeffects.com/" target=_blank>The Vantage Project</a>. If you're interested in the progress and any future release, you can visit it. There's a page for the programmers involved and also a WIP page with some details. They're also announcing a release soon, with new games like Space Laser and Moon War.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Resurrection</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 12:24AM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Peale has taken the old VAntAGE code (look at <a href="http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/emus/multi/vantage.shtml" target=_blank>our VAntAGE page</a>) and he is trying, with the help of some friends, to <a href="http://www.arcadecontrols.org/yabbse/index.php?board=3;action=display;threadid=14020" target=_blank>add new drivers</a>. For now there's a varying degree of success, but there's interest and potential there. VAntAGE is capable of running classics in very old hardware, so you could build a vertical cab with minimal costs. I wish them luck and I hope to hear from this project again very soon.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Not really a surprise...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 7:19PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Well, so much for the "next release will take a long time", here we have <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.40.3</a>. I was expecting this, just a bugfix release, but here it is. The good thing is that (if I read correctly) they have stopped using Allegro and now they use SDL for sound under linux and win32. I still expect a couple more "bugfixes" before the rewrite, if any... Thanks to The Informer for posting this.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

All you need is a color printer, scissors and glue, and "reasonably non-arthritic folding fingers". Since I don't have anything arcade in mine, I think I'm getting the whole collection done.
