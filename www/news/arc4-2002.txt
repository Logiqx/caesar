Many of them with the label of "100% perfect" :) And some with a 2x mode to allow you to play a bit better.<br><br>The only drawback by now is the ausence of sound, but I really hope they will add it soon.

  <tr><th><strong>For the hard wait...</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 10:04PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> May 1st, internationally recognized as Day of the Worker (or something similar depending of the country). Maybe due to that Nicola has chosen today to release the long awaited <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME 0.60 "Attack of the PROMs"</a>.<br><br>As a curious thing, all the added games have appeared on the WIP, there are no "ghost" entries. Primal Rage, Tactician, Taxi Driver, Judge Dredd, the Outfoxies (finally) and Oriental Legend are all there among other names which should sound familiar to you already, up to a total count of 26 games. There are also 20 new clones of existing games, which is a good count for me :) Oh, no CoJag games as I imagined, maybe in the next release...<br><br>There are also lots of fixes which improve greatly the playability of certain games; namely Batsugun, Hot Chase and Wec Le Mans 24 to mention some. There are a total of 16 MAME Testers bugs fixed, at least mentioned there, as usual there might be more. All the details are in the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html">whatsnew.txt</a> file, so read it while you download the biggest arcade emulator. Happy playing! (But hold your breath cause the day hasn't finished yet!)<br>  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Good day for the emulation community</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 9:49PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> If as reading this you think you are reading the last news of the day, you're wrong. Here in CAESAR the last news are in the top, so you have to learn to read backwards from the last news you saw here. I say this cause I try to be careful about the order of the news, and tonight there are many juicy news. Stay tuned as I write them all!  </td></tr>  </table></p>
