The beast is called Zinc, done by the creators of Impact and the S11 preview emu. In fact, S11 + Impact = Zinc. Ths actually means that S11 and Impact are not supported anymore. The first version is <a href="http://www.impactemu.com/">Zinc 0.5</a> and it is available for Linux and *all* Windows flavors. Zinc supports the arcade systems Sony ZN-1 and ZN-2 and Namco System 11. It supports 26 games, 16 have full sound and are fully playable, and only 3 games are not playable. Great!<br>Since this emulator is a predecessor of two others, in its first version it already has "changelog". Well, in short it has fixes, improved performance for both emu and renderer, some new games AND a dynarec with CPU-specific optimizations and configurable performance... Too good!<br>The wait was long, but I feel it was very worth it!

This cute tool has a new mode of operation: Tiny dats. You can use them to produce dats which contain the difference between one dat and another (i.e. emulator updates), but with the tiny mode, you only creat the needed roms, instead of recreating the whole games. This allows to create even smaller updates but still playable (as long as the emulator can use multiple rompaths).<br>As usual, Logiqx has a better explanation in this <a href="http://www.retrogames.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=retrogen&Number=52246&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post52246">forum post</a>, in his own page and in the MAMEDiff.txt. [sarcasm mode on] However, in no place he mentions that the original idea of the tiny dat was mine :) However, I can agree that he has the small merit of expanding the original idea to cover 24 combinations and to develop the whole algorithm, but the idea was mine in first place :-p [sarcasm mode off]<br>You can try both the utility and some suplementary dats for MAME + Raine/Nebula/Kawaks at <a href="http://www.logiqx.com/">Logiqx's homepage</a>.<br>Now I'm running for dinner out and movie session at 1am :)<br>  </td></tr>  </table></p>

Then we can find Ameridarts, Art & Magic System, Killer Instinct (I said it!), Driver's Edge, and three Atari Systems: G42, GX2 and GT. All this sounds too good, but as usual...
