  <tr><th><strong>Three shorties</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 7:14AM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Yesterday it was released <a href="http://www.daphne-emu.com/" target=_blank>DAPHNE 0.99.7</a>, with support for Dragon's Lair 2, Mach 3, Us vs Them, Roadblaster... A good release, but then again, will they go to 1.00 or to 0.100? Oh the doubt, oh the future (j/k). Get the changelog and binaries at the <a href="http://www.daphne-emu.com/download/" target=_blank>DAPHNE Download Page</a>. And Erik Duijs wrote me again to tell me about <a href="http://www.gagaplay.com/" target=_blank>JEmu2 1.6</a>, which can run Street Fighter II nicely. There are cryptic news about a new, faster binary uploaded, and a promised new 68k core which will be even faster. Also, I'd like to mention an update at <a href="http://unmamed.mame.net/" target=_blank>Bobby Tribble's unMAMEd arcade games</a>, fortunately the removed games are more than the added ones ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>

<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 12:44PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> My reaction time lately is 1-2 days, that's why I'm also late for reporting <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/" target=_blank>RAINE 0.43.2</a>. It has new games, Haze added three and Tux added five more, including the Multi Champ games. There are a lot more fixes, specially for Linux dudes & dudettes.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>Pot-a-toe</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 7:36AM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> News about <a href="http://cottage.consolemul.com/" target=_blank>PotatoArcade</a>, the MAME generic driver that the CottAge and Potato Emulation team are working on. Gollum told me that their main objective is to have all games already in CottAge and JEmu. So far, I can see screenshots of 1942, 1943, Mr. Do and others. On the <a href="http://potato.emu-france.com/" target=_blank>PotatoMulti</a> side, CPS1 is already working. Although the screenshots say "Sega Genesis Emulator", you can see games like Cadillac & Dinosaurs or The Punisher running perfectly (according to the authors, that's it).  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>And it even has Indian Battle with sound!</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 2:46PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Aaron has finally finished Aaronizing the code and here we have <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target=_blank>MAME 0.100</a>. Until the binaries are released and the <a href="http://www.mame.net/whatsnew.html" target=_blank>changelog</a> is updated at mame.net, you can get the source code at <a href="http://www.mamedev.com/" target=_blank>MAMEDev.com</a> as usual. There are many good things since the last "official" release, including some core and framework changes. But I'd like to point out the amount of bugfixes and improvements in many drivers and cores. People who say that devs are only interested in adding new games, and not in fixing old bugs or improve existing drivers, should get a clue. Well, this is mainly because there aren't so many games dumped and easy to emulate, so what's left is the hard stuff ^_^ Anyway enjoy this release, and don't pay too much attention to the version number ;)  </td></tr>  </table></p>

  <tr><th><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong><br/> 
<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 11:22PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> Lately I'm posting more news than usually. This time it's ElSemi, who after 18 months of no updates, has released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula 2.25</a>. This Neogeo/CPS/PGM emulator includes updated drivers with the latest additions, enabling Matrimelee and adding Knights of Valour 2. Some improvements and fixes all around and better Neogeo CD compatibility. A good update for the fans of this arcade emulator.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

You can test PotatoMulti 0.02 right now, and read about the news at the <a href="http://cottage.consolemul.com/" target=_blank>CottAGE news page</a>.

The "only" changes are all from Haze, he kindly added seven games to RAINE in the hyperpac and cookbib drivers. That Final Tetris is cool ^_^  </td></tr>  </table></p>

That's if Mr. F. doesn't try to buy them first... Do you know he's trying to buy VPinMAME? Duh...  </td></tr>  </table></p>
