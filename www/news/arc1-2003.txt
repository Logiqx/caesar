A nice thing is a good number of bugs were fixed, and certain issues with graphics and sounds have been fixed and/or improved as well (specially MegaSystem 32). On the game department, you get Ribbit! among other things. Nice to see back some regular releases, enjoy this one and await the flood of MAME-related updates.  </td></tr>  </table></p>

It's not the same as the "leaked" 2.22 version, so don't be confused; redownload. It has quite a lot of fixes, including crashing on 32bit desktops (like mine) and the infamous step fram in the shots factory. It also includes an option similar to the Kawaks WinAmp Jukebox, and I think this one has some good possibilities. It works with WinAmp Classic, heh :) Oh check also his D3D blitter, it has an enhanced version of FBA's FishBowl with reflections and all... Too bad, again my Voodoo will not do :/  </td></tr>  </table></p>

There is also this Area 51 / Maximum Force Duo game, with a CHD of 1.6gb, not playable on most computers like all the CoJag games but still I bet it will cause massive bandwidth consumption. There are snaps of more games, like two japanese quiz for the Jaleco Megasystem 32, and Avengers in Galactic Storm, none of these working well yet, but on their way. Plus there are quite some good fixes and improvements here and there, for example <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/8859/" target=_blank>Shiriru</a> is still fixing the CPS2 driver, lots of clones and raster effects in Edward Randy got fixed too.  </td></tr>  </table></p>
