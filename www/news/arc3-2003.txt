<small>Posted by <a href="/info/about.shtml">pi</a> at at 2:05PM [BST]</small>  </th></tr>  <tr><td> So I have to start somewhere, or I'll drown in late news... Here they are, in random order:<br><br>First of all, there were lots of <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip/" target=_blank>MAME WIP</a> reports. Most of them are already archived, so visit <a href="http://www.mame.net/wip0304.html" target=_blank>April's archive</a> to see them.<br><br>Other places where you could see more MAME work in progress were <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/tourniquet/" target=_blank>Tourniquet's MAME News</a>, with some discussion about a revamp in the graphics core (and he had some nice revamp in the site colors too). <a href="http://rbelmont.nm.ru/" target=_blank>R. Belmont's WIP Emporium</a> had also some things I could see, but the latest update includes a Sexy Parodius gaming tip and Haze's work with Salamander 2's backgrounds. Talking about him, there are still some pics at <a href="http://haze.mame.net/" target=_blank>Haze's MAME Page</a> with his latest work in Outrunners. So he got hang of System32 again, spooky :)<br><br>Somehow this link appeared in my notes, it's a Marble Madness remake called <a href="http://xiaou2.homestead.com/marbleinsanity.html" target=_blank>Marble Insanity</a>. It looks really really good, I hope it's released soon. Thanks to whoever posted or mentioned it!<br><br>David wrote me about <a href="http://www.gamecabinetsinc.com/" target=_blank>Game Cabinets Inc.</a>, a company specialized in cabinets and arcade controls. Usually I don't mention these, but what the hell. Looking good. I accept donations to <i>test</i> some of their products ;)<br><br>Not arcade related, but I saw <a href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/" target=_blank>DOSBox 0.58</a>, a pretty stable release. Friggin' good for your retrogaming needs too... I'll play some oldies.<br><br>I saw this post by Kevin Steele about an <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=mamewrldstretch&Number=1763&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=5#Post1763" target=_blank>Universal Vertical Game Bezel</a>, it looks interesting. Get it at <a href="http://users.adelphia.net/~kevsteele/mame/index.html" target=_blank>Kevin's site</a>.<br><br>ElSemi released <a href="http://nebula.emulatronia.com/" target=_blank>Nebula Model 2 0.8</a>. Apparently tehre are no new games, but some fixes, working frame limiter, and tilemap features.<br><br>And Eldio hasn't finished the new <a href="http://emam.mameworld.net/" target=_blank>EMAM</a> but he already left there the marquees for you.<br><br>Alexis released <a href="http://fandemame.emu-france.com/" target=_blank>History.dat 0.66A</a>, as he says a big release with descriptions for fighting games, a new ports section (nice!), more japanese games dejapped, and well, lots of new information. <a href="http://www.mameworld.net/mameinfo/" target=_blank>M.A.S.H.'s MameInfo.dat 4.64</a> was out too, I guess these guys will update for 0.67 very soon.<br><br>To fight the enemy, you gotta know it, so <a href="http://dmca.blogs.eff.org/" target=_blank>Debunking DMCA</a> should help you in this task. Remember that IDSA is something different, so this only covers *one* of the multiple enemies. Again I don't remember how this link landed in my notes...<br><br>Guru has put a new <a href="http://unemulated.emuunlim.com/namco/index.html" target=_blank>Namco System 10/11/12 dump status</a> page, in the line of the Model 2 page. Full of info, some dissapoinments and some surprises.</li></ul>And now I'm going to check if I can make work any of those new games in the latest MAME. I guess tonight and tomorrow there will be lots of updates regarding it, so come back, k?  </td></tr>  </table></p>
